                               PREFACE.


Whether a translation of HOMER may be best executed in blank verse or
in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find
difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be,
or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very
different kinds of versification. I will venture to assert that a just
translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is impossible. No human
ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with
sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time the full sense, and
only the full sense of his original. The translator's ingenuity,
indeed, in this case becomes itself a snare, and the readier he is at
invention and expedient, the more likely he is to be betrayed into the
widest departures from the guide whom he professes to follow. Hence it
has happened, that although the public have long been in possession of
an English HOMER by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to
his country, the demand of a new one, and especially in blank verse,
has been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and
ablest writers of the present day.

I have no contest with my predecessor. None is supposable between
performers on different instruments. Mr. Pope has surmounted all
difficulties in his version of HOMER that it was possible to surmount
in rhyme. But he was fettered, and his fetters were his choice.
Accustomed always to rhyme, he had formed to himself an ear which
probably could not be much gratified by verse that wanted it, and
determined to encounter even impossibilities, rather than abandon a
mode of writing in which he had excelled every body, for the sake of
another to which, unexercised in it as he was, he must have felt
strong objections.

I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr. Pope as an original
writer, and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim as the
translator of this chief of poets. He has given us the _Tale of Troy
divine_ in smooth verse, generally in correct and elegant language,
and in diction often highly poetical. But his deviations are so many,
occasioned chiefly by the cause already mentioned, that, much as he
has done, and valuable as his work is on some accounts, it was yet in
the humble province of a translator that I thought it possible even
for me to fellow him with some advantage.

That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author,
and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it, is a remark
which, on this occasion, nothing but necessity should have extorted
from me. But we differ sometimes so widely in our matter, that unless
this remark, invidious as it seems, be premised, I know not how to
obviate a suspicion, on the one hand, of careless oversight, or of
factitious embellishment on the other. On this head, therefore, the
English reader is to be admonished, that the matter found in me,
whether he like it or not, is found also in HOMER, and that the matter
not found in me, how much soever he may admire it, is found only in
Mr. Pope. I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing.

There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an
original writer in rhyme and a translator. In an original work the
author is free; if the rhyme be of difficult attainment, and he cannot
find it in one direction, he is at liberty to seek it in another; the
matter that will not accommodate itself to his occasions he may
discard, adopting such as will. But in a translation no such option is
allowable; the sense of the author is required, and we do not
surrender it willingly even to the plea of necessity. Fidelity is
indeed of the very essence of translation, and the term itself implies
it. For which reason, if we suppress the sense of our original, and
force into its place our own, we may call our work an _imitation_, if
we please, or perhaps a _paraphrase_, but it is no longer the same
author only in a different dress, and therefore it is not translation.
Should a painter, professing to draw the likeness of a beautiful
woman, give her more or fewer features than belong to her, and a
general cast of countenance of his own invention, he might be said to
have produced a _jeu d'esprit_, a curiosity perhaps in its way, but by
no means the lady in question.

It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to this
subject, on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges.

The free and the close translation have, each, their advocates. But
inconveniences belong to both. The former can hardly be true to the
original author's style and manner, and the latter is apt to be
servile. The one loses his peculiarities, and the other his spirit.
Were it possible, therefore, to find an exact medium, a manner so
close that it should let slip nothing of the text, nor mingle any
thing extraneous with it, and at the same time so free as to have an
air of originality, this seems precisely the mode in which an author
might be best rendered. I can assure my readers from my own
experience, that to discover this very delicate line is difficult, and
to proceed by it when found, through the whole length of a poet
voluminous as HOMER, nearly impossible. I can only pretend to have
endeavored it.

It is an opinion commonly received, but, like many others, indebted
for its prevalence to mere want of examination, that a translator
should imagine to himself the style which his author would probably
have used, had the language into which he is rendered been his own. A
direction which wants nothing but practicability to recommend it. For
suppose six persons, equally qualified for the task, employed to
translate the same Ancient into their own language, with this rule to
guide them. In the event it would be found, that each had fallen on a
manner different from that of all the rest, and by probable inference
it would follow that none had fallen on the right. On the whole,
therefore, as has been said, the translation which partakes equally of
fidelity and liberality, that is close, but not so close as to be
servile, free, but not so free as to be licentious, promises fairest;
and my ambition will be sufficiently gratified, if such of my readers
as are able, and will take the pains to compare me in this respect
with HOMER, shall judge that I have in any measure attained a point so
difficult.

As to energy and harmony, two grand requisites in a translation of
this most energetic and most harmonious of all poets, it is neither my
purpose nor my wish, should I be found deficient in either, or in
both, to shelter myself under an unfilial imputation of blame to my
mother-tongue. Our language is indeed less musical than the Greek, and
there is no language with which I am at all acquainted that is not.
But it is musical enough for the purposes of melodious verse, and if
it seem to fail, on whatsoever occasion, in energy, the blame is due,
not to itself, but to the unskilful manager of it. For so long as
Milton's works, whether his prose or his verse, shall exist, so long
there will be abundant proof that no subject, however important,
however sublime, can demand greater force of expression than is within
the compass of the English language.

I have no fear of judges familiar with original HOMER. They need not
be told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise, and as
such, entitled to some favor. From these, therefore, I shall expect,
and shall not be disappointed, considerable candor and allowance.
Especially _they_ will be candid, and I believe that there are many
such, who have occasionally tried their own strength in this _bow of
Ulysses_. They have not found it supple and pliable, and with me are
perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not always even approach
with it the mark of their ambition. But I would willingly, were it
possible, obviate uncandid criticism, because to answer it is lost
labor, and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately
reserve, and self-importance.

To those, therefore, who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter that
my diction is often plain and unelevated, I reply beforehand that I
know it,--that it would be absurd were it otherwise, and that Homer
himself stands in the same predicament. In fact, it is one of his
numberless excellences, and a point in which his judgment never fails
him, that he is grand and lofty always in the right place, and knows
infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject. _Big words on small
matters_ may serve as a pretty exact definition of the burlesque; an
instance of which they will find in the Battle of the Frogs and Mice,
but none in the Iliad.

By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and there
tolerably smooth, are not always such, but have, now and then, an ugly
hitch in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and inconvenient to the
reader. To this charge also I plead guilty, but beg leave in
alleviation of judgment to add, that my limping lines are not
numerous, compared with those that limp not. The truth is, that not
one of them all escaped me, but, such as they are, they were all made
such with a wilful intention. In poems of great length there is no
blemish more to be feared than sameness of numbers, and every art is
useful by which it may be avoided. A line, rough in itself, has yet
its recommendations; it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony,
and seems even to add greater smoothness to others. Milton, whose ear
and taste were exquisite, has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the
effect of this practice frequently.

Having mentioned Milton, I cannot but add an observation on the
similitude of his manner to that of HOMER. It is such, that no person
familiar with both, can read either without being reminded of the
other; and it is in those breaks and pauses, to which the numbers of
the English poet are so much indebted both for their dignity and
variety, that he chiefly copies the Grecian. But these are graces to
which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it loses all its music; of
which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of
our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and Dryden. A translator of
HOMER, therefore, seems directed by HOMER himself to the use of blank
verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable
representation of his manner in this particular. A remark which I am
naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate, if possible, some,
who, rather unreasonably partial to rhyme, demand it on all occasions,
and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt
without it. Verse, that claims to be verse in right of its metre only,
they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an
apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble, that he has only
to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables, and so far as
the mechanical part is concerned, all is well. Were this true, they
would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best
entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and
in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its
construction. But the case is not as they suppose. To rhyme, in our
language, demands no great exertion of ingenuity, but is always easy
to a person exercised in the practice. Witness the multitudes who
rhyme, but have no other poetical pretensions. Let it be considered
too, how merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent
language for the sake of rhyme, and we shall soon see that the labor
lies principally on the other side. Many ornaments of no easy purchase
are required to atone for the absence of this single recommendation.
It is not sufficient that the lines of blank verse be smooth in
themselves, they must also be harmonious in the combination. Whereas
the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware that his couplets and
his sense be commensurate, lest the regularity of his numbers should
be (too frequently at least) interrupted. A trivial difficulty this,
compared with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells.
He, in order that he may be musical, must exhibit all the variations,
as he proceeds, of which ten syllables are susceptible; between the
first syllable and the last there is no place at which he must not
occasionally pause, and the place of the pause must be perpetually
shifted. To effect this variety, his attention must be given, at one
and the same time, to the pauses he has already made in the period
before him, as well as to that which he is about to make, and to those
which shall succeed it. On no lighter terms than these is it possible
that blank verse can be written which will not, in the course of a
long work, fatigue the ear past all endurance. If it be easier,
therefore, to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in
succession, than to sport in that manner with one only, then may blank
verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these labors we
add others equally requisite, a style in general more elaborate than
rhyme requires, farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the
language itself and in the arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt
which of these two very different species of verse threatens the
composer with most expense of study and contrivance. I feel it
unpleasant to appeal to my own experience, but, having no other
voucher at hand, am constrained to it. As I affirm, so I have found. I
have dealt pretty largely in both kinds, and have frequently written
more verses in a day, with tags, than I could ever write without them.
To what has been here said (which whether it have been said by others
or not, I cannot tell, having never read any modern book on the
subject) I shall only add, that to be poetical without rhyme, is an
argument of a sound and classical constitution in any language.

A word or two on the subject of the following translation, and I have
done.

My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original,
convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the
forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no
equivalent. The epithets that would consent to an English form I have
preserved as epithets; others that would not, I have melted into the
context. There are none, I believe, which I have not translated in one
way or other, though the reader will not find them repeated so often
as most of them are in HOMER, for a reason that need not be mentioned.

Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or
Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also. To
this ceremonial I have generally attended, because it is a
circumstance of my author's manner.

HOMER never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a
speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than the
line that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs from
it, he must have been determined by some cogent reason. He probably
deemed it a formality necessary to the majesty of his narration. In
this article, therefore, I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern,
considering these introductory lines as heralds in a procession;
important persons, because employed to usher in persons more important
than themselves.

It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible,
though; at the same time, my constant determination not to sacrifice
my author's full meaning to an affected brevity.

In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor to
bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both
these faults, as HOMER, though himself never guilty of either. I have
cautiously avoided all terms of new invention, with an abundance of
which, persons of more ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our
language, but incumbered it. I have also every where used an
unabbreviated fullness of phrase as most suited to the nature of the
work, and, above all, have studied perspicuity, not only because verse
is good for little that wants it, but because HOMER is the most
perspicuous of all poets.

In all difficult places I have consulted the best commentators, and
where they have differed, or have given, as is often the case, a
variety of solutions, I have ever exercised my best judgment, and
selected that which appears, at least to myself, the most probable
interpretation. On this ground, and on account of the fidelity which I
have already boasted, I may venture, I believe, to recommend my work
as promising some usefulness to young students of the original.

The passages which will be least noticed, and possibly not at all,
except by those who shall wish to find me at a fault, are those which
have cost me abundantly the most labor. It is difficult to kill a
sheep with dignity in a modern language, to flay and to prepare it for
the table, detailing every circumstance of the process. Difficult
also, without sinking below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a
wagon, particularizing every article of their furniture, straps,
rings, staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all
together. HOMER, who writes always to the eye, with all his sublimity
and grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter.

But in what degree I have succeeded in my version either of these
passages, and such as these, or of others more buoyant and
above-ground, and especially of the most sublime, is now submitted to
the decision of the reader, to whom I am ready enough to confess that
I have not at all consulted their approbation, who account nothing
grand that is not turgid, or elegant that is not bedizened with
metaphor.

I purposely decline all declamation on the merits of HOMER, because a
translator's praises of his author are liable to a suspicion of
dotage, and because it were impossible to improve on those which this
author has received already. He has been the wonder of all countries
that his works have ever reached, even deified by the greatest names
of antiquity, and in some places actually worshipped. And to say
truth, were it possible that mere man could entitle himself by
pre-eminence of any kind to divine honors, Homer's astonishing powers
seem to have given him the best pretensions.

I cannot conclude without due acknowledgments to the best critic in
HOMER I have ever met with, the learned and ingenious Mr. FUSELI.
Unknown as he was to me when I entered on this arduous undertaking
(indeed to this moment I have never seen him) he yet voluntarily and
generously offered himself as my revisor. To his classical taste and
just discernment I have been indebted for the discovery of many
blemishes in my own work, and of beauties, which would otherwise have
escaped me, in the original. But his necessary avocations would not
suffer him to accompany me farther than to the latter books of the
Iliad, a circumstance which I fear my readers, as well as myself, will
regret with too much reason.[1]

I have obligations likewise to many friends, whose names, were it
proper to mention them here, would do me great honor. They have
encouraged me by their approbation, have assisted me with valuable
books, and have eased me of almost the whole labor of transcribing.

And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended. To the
illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand
hours. He has been my companion at home and abroad, in the study, in
the garden, and in the field; and no measure of success, let my labors
succeed as they may, will ever compensate to me the loss of the
innocent luxury that I have enjoyed, as a translator of HOMER.

                               PREFACE
                        PREPARED BY MR. COWPER,
                                FOR A
                           SECOND EDITION.


Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it for a
second edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It seemed to me,
that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the
demands of some, whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself
with the reflection, that if I still failed to conciliate all, I
should yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree
unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an author must sacrifice
too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether
hopeless. In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such
objectors, as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal
advantages, the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny
the good effect, on the whole, of a line, now and then, less
harmonious than its fellows.

With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable
rashness, that HOMER himself has given me an example of verse without
them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against
the use of them in an English version of HOMER; because, in one
language, and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in
another would be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally
unfounded. The pauses in Homer's verse are so frequent and various,
that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he,
were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single
passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be
singled out from all the thousands that he has left us. He frequently
pauses at the first word of the line, when it consists of three or
more syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one
only. In this practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface
to the first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example
inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse without
rhyme can neglect with impunity.

Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the
occasional use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace censured
Lucilius for his lines _incomposite pede currentes_, he did not mean
to say, that he was chargeable with such in some instances, or even in
many, for then the censure would have been equally applicable to
himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his
writings. The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time
when the Roman verse had not yet received its polish, and instead of
introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a particular
purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed a
smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest poets in
every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in time,
their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught, harmonious.

HOMER himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his
verse. Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm
admirer of HOMER, had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a
head, some a tail, and others a middle. Some begin with a word that is
neither dactyl nor spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in the
intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the established
custom. I confess that instances of this sort are rare; but they are
surely, though few, sufficient to warrant a sparing use of similar
license in the present day.

Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars, I
conformed myself in some measure to these objections, though
unconvinced myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and most
unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses least in
use I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation.--And this was
the state of the work after the revisal given it about seven years
since.

Between that revisal and the present a considerable time intervened,
and the effect of long discontinuance was, that I became more
dissatisfied with it myself, than the most difficult to be pleased of
all my judges. Not for the sake of a few uneven lines or unwonted
pauses, but for reasons far more substantial. The diction seemed to me
in many passages either not sufficiently elevated, or deficient in the
grace of ease, and in others I found the sense of the original either
not adequately expressed or misapprehended. Many elisions still
remained unsoftened; the compound epithets I found not always happily
combined, and the same sometimes too frequently repeated.

There is no end of passages in HOMER, which must creep unless they are
lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the question. The
hero puts on his clothes, or refreshes himself with food and wine, or
he yokes his steed, takes a journey, and in the evening preparation is
made for his repose. To give relief to subjects prosaic as these
without seeming unreasonably tumid is extremely difficult. Mr. Pope
much abridges some of them, and others he omits; but neither of these
liberties was compatible with the nature of my undertaking. These,
therefore, and many similar to these, have been new-modeled; somewhat
to their advantage I hope, but not even now entirely to my
satisfaction. The lines have a more natural movement, the pauses are
fewer and less stately, the expression as easy as I could make it
without meanness, and these were all the improvements that I could
give them.

The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception. An
alternative proposes itself to a modern versifier, from which there is
no escape, which occurs perpetually, and which, choose as he may,
presents him always with an evil. I mean in the instance of the
particle (_the_). When this particle precedes a vowel, shall he melt
it into the substantive, or leave the _hiatus_ open? Both practices
are offensive to a delicate ear. The particle absorbed occasions
harshness, and the open vowel a vacuity equally inconvenient.
Sometimes, therefore, to leave it open, and sometimes to ingraft it
into its adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr. Pope has taken,
whose authority recommended it to me; though of the two evils I have
most frequently chosen the elision as the least.

Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of
our country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have
abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds
with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would
have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors
the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it
happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered
in English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and
because I found that some readers much disliked them, I have expunged
many; retaining, according to my best judgment, the most eligible
only, and making less frequent the repetitions even of these.

I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this
last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad,
though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the
Odyssey. The true reason I believe is this. The Iliad demanded my
utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost
perpendicular, which could not be surmounted at less cost than of all
the labor that I could bestow on it. The Odyssey on the contrary
seemed to resemble an open and level country, through which I might
travel at my ease. The latter, therefore, betrayed me into some
negligence, which, though little conscious of it at the time, on an
accurate search, I found had left many disagreeable effects behind it.

I now leave the work to its fate. Another may labor hereafter in an
attempt of the same kind with more success; but more industriously, I
believe, none ever will.




                               PREFACE
                                  BY
                          J. JOHNSON, LL.B.
               CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.


I have no other pretensions to the honorable name of Editor on this
occasion, than as a faithful transcriber of the Manuscript, and a
diligent corrector of the Press, which are, doubtless, two of the very
humblest employments in that most extensive province. I have wanted
the ability to attempt any thing higher; and, fortunately for the
reader, I have also wanted the presumption. What, however, I can do, I
will. Instead of critical remark, I will furnish him with anecdote. He
shall trace from beginning to end the progress of the following work;
and in proportion as I have the happiness to engage his attention, I
shall merit the name of a fortunate editor.

It was in the darkest season of a most calamitous depression of his
spirits, that I was summoned to the house of my inestimable friend the
Translator, in the month of January, 1794. He had happily completed a
revisal of his HOMER, and was thinking of the preface to his new
edition, when all his satisfaction in the one, and whatever he had
projected for the other, in a moment vanished from his mind. He had
fallen into a deplorable illness; and though the foremost wish of my
heart was to lessen the intenseness of his misery, I was utterly
unable to afford him any aid.

I had, however, a pleasing though a melancholy opportunity of tracing
his recent footsteps in the Field of Troy, and in the Palace of
Ithaca. He had materially altered both the Iliad and Odyssey; and, so
far as my ability allowed me to judge, they were each of them greatly
improved. He had also, at the request of his bookseller, interspersed
the two poems with copious notes; for the most part translations of
the ancient Scholia, and gleaned, at the cost of many valuable hours,
from the pages of Barnes, Clarke, and Villoisson. It has been a
constant subject of regret to the admirers of "The Task," that the
exercise of such marvelous original powers, should have been so long
suspended by the drudgery of translation; and in this view, their
quarrel with the illustrious Greek will be, doubtless, extended to his
commentators.[1]

During two long years from this most anxious period, the translation
continued as it was; and though, in the hope of its being able to
divert his melancholy, I had attempted more than once to introduce it
to its Author, I was every time painfully obliged to desist. But in
the summer of ninety-six, when he had resided with me in Norfolk
twelve miserable months, the introduction long wished for took place.
To my inexpressible astonishment and joy, I surprised him, one
morning, with the Iliad in his hand; and with an excess of delight,
which I am still more unable to describe, I the next day discovered
that he had been writing.--Were I to mention one of the happiest
moments of my life, it might be that which introduced me to the
following lines:--

                     Mistaken meanings corrected,
                       admonente G. Wakefield.

  B. XXIII.
  L. 429.                               that the nave
            Of thy neat wheel seem e'en to grind upon it.

  L. 865.   As when (the north wind freshening) near the bank
            Up springs a fish in air, then falls again
            And disappears beneath the sable flood,
            So at the stroke, he bounded.

  L. 1018.  Thenceforth Tydides o'er his ample shield
            Aim'd and still aim'd to pierce him in the neck.

                           Or better thus--

            Tydides, in return, with spear high-poised
            O'er the broad shield, aim'd ever at his neck,

                           Or best of all--

            Then Tydeus' son, with spear high-poised above
            The ample shield, stood aiming at his neck.

He had written these lines with a pencil, on a leaf at the end of his
Iliad; and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth, I
could not but admire its disproportion to the effect. What the voice
of persuasion had failed in for a year, accident had silently
accomplished in a single day. The circumstance I allude to was this: I
received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope, then recently
published by the Editor above mentioned, with illustrative and
critical notes of his own. As it commended Mr. Cowper's Translation in
the Preface, and occasionally pointed out its merits in the Notes, I
was careful to place it in his way; though it was more from a habit of
experiment which I had contracted, than from well-grounded hopes of
success. But what a fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this
Work! and by what name worthy of its influence shall I call it? In the
mouth of an indifferent person it might be Chance; but in mine; whom
it rendered so peculiarly happy, common gratitude requires that it
should be Providence.

As I watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress, I had
the satisfaction to find, that, after a few mornings given to
promiscuous correction, and to frequent perusal of the above-mentioned
Notes, he was evidently settling on the sixteenth Book. This he went
regularly through, and the fruits of an application so happily resumed
were, one day with another, about sixty new lines. But with the end of
the sixteenth Book he had closed the corrections of the year. An
excursion to the coast, which immediately followed, though it promised
an accession of strength to the body, could not fail to interfere with
the pursuits of the mind. It was therefore with much less surprise
than regret, that I saw him relinquish the "_Tale of Troy Divine_."

Such was the prelude to the last revisal, which, in the month of
January, ninety-seven, Mr. Cowper was persuaded to undertake; and to a
faithful copy, as I trust, of which, I have at this time the honor to
conduct the reader. But it may not be amiss to observe, that with
regard to the earlier books of the Iliad, it was less a revisal of the
altered text, than of the text as it stands in the first edition. For
though the interleaved copy was always at hand, and in the multitude
of its altered places could hardly fail to offer some things worthy to
be preserved, but which the ravages of illness and the lapse of time
might have utterly effaced from his mind, I could not often persuade
the Translator to consult it. I was therefore induced, in the course
of transcribing, to compare the two revisals as I went along, and to
plead for the continuance of the first correction, when it forcibly
struck me as better than the last. This, however, but seldom occurred;
and the practice, at length, was completely left off, by his
consenting to receive into the number of the books which were daily
laid open before him, the interleaved copy to which I allude.

At the end of the first six books of the Iliad, the arrival of spring
brought the usual interruptions of exercise and air, which increased
as the summer advanced to a degree so unfavorable to the progress of
HOMER, that in the requisite attention to their salutary claims, the
revisal was, at one time, altogether at a stand. Only four books were
added in the course of nine months; but opportunity returning as the
winter set in, there were added, in less than seven weeks, four more:
and thus ended the year ninety-seven.

As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring, so it led to a
happier summer. We had no longer air and exercise alone, but exercise
and Homer hand in hand. He even followed us thrice to the sea: and
whether our walks were

                    "on the margin of the land,
  O'er the green summit of the" cliffs, "whose base
  Beats back the roaring surge,"
                        "or on the shore
  Of the untillable and barren deep,"

they were always within hearing of his magic song. About the middle of
this busy summer, the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and
on the very next day, the 24th of July, the correction of the Odyssey
commenced,--a morning rendered memorable by a kind and unexpected
visit from the patroness of that work, the Dowager Lady Spencer!

It is not my intention to detain the reader with a progressive account
of the Odyssey revised, as circumstantial as that of the Iliad,
because it went on smoothly from beginning to end, and was finished in
less than eight months.

I cannot deliver these volumes to the public without feeling emotions
of gratitude toward Heaven, in recollecting how often this corrected
Work has appeared to me an instrument of Divine mercy, to mitigate the
sufferings of my excellent relation. Its progress in our private hours
was singularly medicinal to his mind: may its presentment to the
Public prove not less conducive to the honor of the departed Author,
who has every claim to my veneration! As a copious life of the Poet is
already in the press, from the pen of his intimate friend Mr. Hayley,
it is unnecessary for me to enter on such extensive commendation of
his character, as my own intimacy with him might suggest; but I hope
the reader will kindly allow me the privilege of indulging, in some
degree, the feelings of my heart, by applying to him, in the close of
this Preface, an expressive verse (borrowed from Homer) which he
inscribed himself, with some little variation, on a bust of his
Grecian Favorite.

           {รs te patรชr รด paidi, kai oupote lรชsomai aute.}

                Loved as his Son, in him I early found
                A Father, such as I will ne'er forget.

Footnote:
1. Very few signatures had at this time been affixed to the notes; but
   I afterward compared them with the Greek, note by note, and
   endeavored to supply the defect; more especially in the last three
   Volumes, where the reader will be pleased to observe that all the
   notes without signatures are Mr. Cowper's, and that those marked
   B.C.V. are respectively found in the editions of Homer by Barnes,
   Clarke, and Villoisson. But the employment was so little to the
   taste and inclination of the poet, that he never afterward revised
   them, or added to their number more than these which follow;--In
   the Odyssey, Vol. I. Book xi., the note 32.--Vol. II. Book xv., the
   note 13.--The note 10 Book xvi., of that volume, and the note 14,
   Book xix., of the same.




                  ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY'S EDITION


It is incumbent upon the present Editor to state the reasons which
have induced him, between two editions of Cowper's HOMER, differing so
materially from each other that they might almost be deemed different
versions, to prefer the first.

Whoever has perused the Translator's letters, must have perceived that
he had considered with no ordinary care the scheme of his
versification, and that when he resolved upon altering it in a second
edition, it was in deference to the opinion of others.

It seems to the Editor that Cowper's own judgment is entitled to more
respect, than that of any, or all his critics; and that the version
which he composed when his faculties were most active and his spirits
least subject to depression,--indeed in the happiest part of his
life,--ought not to be superseded by a revisal, or rather
reconstruction, which was undertaken three years before his
death,--not like the first translation as "a pleasant work, an
innocent luxury," the cheerful and delightful occupation of hope and
ardor and ambition,--but as a "hopeless employment," a task to which
he gave "all his miserable days, and often many hours of the night,"
seeking to beguile the sense of utter wretchedness, by altering as if
for the sake of alteration.

The Editor has been confirmed in this opinion by the concurrence of
every person with whom he has communicated on the subject. Among
others he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr. Cary, whose authority
upon such a question is of especial weight, the Translator of Dante
being the only one of our countrymen who has ever executed a
translation of equal magnitude and not less difficulty, with the same
perfect fidelity and admirable skill.

In support of this determination, the case of Tasso may be cited as
curiously in point. The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like
Cowper, against his own judgment, in submission to his critics: he
made the alteration in the latter years of his life, and in a diseased
state of mind; and he proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of
smoothing down his versification, and removing all the elisions. The
consequence has been that the reconstructed poem is utterly neglected,
and has rarely, if ever, been reprinted, except in the two great
editions of his collected works; while the original poem has been and
continues to be in such demand, that the most diligent bibliographer
might vainly attempt to enumerate all the editions through which it
has passed.




                            EDITOR'S NOTE.


It will be seen by the Advertisement to Southey's edition of Cowper's
Translation of the Iliad, that he has the highest opinion of its
merits, and that he also gives the preference to Cowper's unrevised
edition. The Editor of the present edition is happy to offer it to the
public under the sanction of such high authority.

In the addition of notes I have availed myself of the learning of
various commentators (Pope, Coleridge, Mรผller, etc.) and covet no
higher praise than the approval of my judgment in the selection.

Those bearing the signature E.P.P., were furnished by my friend Miss
Peabody, of Boston. I would also acknowledge my obligations to C.C.
Felton, Eliot Professor of Greek in Harvard University. It should be
observed, that the remarks upon the language of the poem refer to it
in the original.

For a definite treatment of the character of each deity introduced in
the Iliad, and for the fable of the Judgment of Paris, which was the
primary cause of the Trojan war, the reader is referred to "Grecian
and Roman Mythology."

It is intended that this edition of the Iliad shall be followed by a
similar one of the Odyssey, provided sufficient encouragement is given
by the demand for the present volume.

                     ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK.


The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the
Grecian camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is called, in
which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles.
The latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon, by his heralds,
demands Brisรซis, and Achilles resigns her. He makes his complaint to
Thetis, who undertakes to plead his cause with Jupiter. She pleads it,
and prevails. The book concludes with an account of what passed in
Heaven on that occasion.

                  *       *       *       *       *

[The reader will please observe, that by Achaians, Argives, Danaรฏ, are
signified Grecians. Homer himself having found these various
appellatives both graceful and convenient, it seemed unreasonable that
a Translator of him should be denied the same advantage.--TR.]




                               BOOK I.


  Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son;
  His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes
  Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul
  Illustrious into Ades premature,
  And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove)                      5
  To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey,
  When fierce dispute had separated once
  The noble Chief Achilles from the son
  Of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men.
    Who them to strife impell'd? What power divine?               10
  Latona's son and Jove's.[1] For he, incensed
  Against the King, a foul contagion raised
  In all the host, and multitudes destroy'd,
  For that the son of Atreus had his priest
  Dishonored, Chryses. To the fleet he came                       15
  Bearing rich ransom glorious to redeem
  His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath
  And golden sceptre[2] of the God shaft-arm'd.
    His supplication was at large to all
  The host of Greece, but most of all to two,                     20
  The sons of Atreus, highest in command.
    Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host,
  (So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell
  Give Priam's treasures to you for a spoil
  And ye return in safety,) take my gifts                         25
  And loose my child, in honor of the son
  Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies.[3]
    At once the voice of all was to respect
  The priest, and to accept the bounteous price;
  But so it pleased not Atreus' mighty son,                       30
  Who with rude threatenings stern him thence dismiss'd.
    Beware, old man! that at these hollow barks
  I find thee not now lingering, or henceforth
  Returning, lest the garland of thy God
  And his bright sceptre should avail thee nought.                35
  I will not loose thy daughter, till old age
  Steal on her. From her native country far,
  In Argos, in my palace, she shall ply
  The loom, and shall be partner of my bed.
  Move me no more. Begone; hence while thou may'st.               40
    He spake, the old priest trembled and obey'd.
  Forlorn he roamed the ocean's sounding shore,
  And, solitary, with much prayer his King
  Bright-hair'd Latona's son, Phoebus, implored.[4]
    God of the silver bow, who with thy power                     45
  Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme
  In Tenedos and Cilla the divine,
  Sminthian[5] Apollo![6] If I e'er adorned
  Thy beauteous fane, or on the altar burn'd
  The fat acceptable of bulls or goats,                           50
  Grant my petition. With thy shafts avenge
  On the Achaian host thy servant's tears.
    Such prayer he made, and it was heard.[7] The God,
  Down from Olympus with his radiant bow
  And his full quiver o'er his shoulder slung,                    55
  Marched in his anger; shaken as he moved
  His rattling arrows told of his approach.
  Gloomy he came as night; sat from the ships
  Apart, and sent an arrow. Clang'd the cord
  [8]Dread-sounding, bounding on the silver bow.[9]               60
  Mules first and dogs he struck,[10] but at themselves
  Dispatching soon his bitter arrows keen,
  Smote them. Death-piles on all sides always blazed.
  Nine days throughout the camp his arrows flew;
  The tenth, Achilles from all parts convened                     65
  The host in council. Juno the white-armed
  Moved at the sight of Grecians all around
  Dying, imparted to his mind the thought.[11]
  The full assembly, therefore, now convened,
  Uprose Achilles ardent, and began.                              70
    Atrides! Now, it seems, no course remains
  For us, but that the seas roaming again,
  We hence return; at least if we survive;
  But haste, consult we quick some prophet here
  Or priest, or even interpreter of dreams,                       75
  (For dreams are also of Jove,) that we may learn
  By what crime we have thus incensed Apollo,
  What broken vow, what hecatomb unpaid
  He charges on us, and if soothed with steam
  Of lambs or goats unblemish'd, he may yet                       80
  Be won to spare us, and avert the plague.
    He spake and sat, when Thestor's son arose
  Calchas, an augur foremost in his art,
  Who all things, present, past, and future knew,
  And whom his skill in prophecy, a gift                          85
  Conferred by Phoebus on him, had advanced
  To be conductor of the fleet to Troy;
  He, prudent, them admonishing, replied.[12]
    Jove-loved Achilles! Wouldst thou learn from me
  What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath,                     90
  The shaft-arm'd King? I shall divulge the cause.
  But thou, swear first and covenant on thy part
  That speaking, acting, thou wilt stand prepared
  To give me succor; for I judge amiss,
  Or he who rules the Argives, the supreme                        95
  O'er all Achaia's host, will be incensed.
  Wo to the man who shall provoke the King
  For if, to-day, he smother close his wrath,
  He harbors still the vengeance, and in time
  Performs it. Answer, therefore, wilt thou save me?             100
    To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.
  What thou hast learn'd in secret from the God
  That speak, and boldly. By the son of Jove,
  Apollo, whom thou, Calchas, seek'st in prayer
  Made for the Danaรฏ, and who thy soul                           105
  Fills with futurity, in all the host
  The Grecian lives not, who while I shall breathe,
  And see the light of day, shall in this camp
  Oppress thee; no, not even if thou name
  Him, Agamemnon, sovereign o'er us all.                         110
    Then was the seer embolden'd, and he spake.
  Nor vow nor hecatomb unpaid on us
  He charges, but the wrong done to his priest
  Whom Agamemnon slighted when he sought
  His daughter's freedom, and his gifts refused.                 115
  He is the cause. Apollo for his sake
  Afflicts and will afflict us, neither end
  Nor intermission of his heavy scourge
  Granting, 'till unredeem'd, no price required,
  The black-eyed maid be to her father sent,                     120
  And a whole hecatomb in Chrysa bleed.
  Then, not before, the God may be appeased.
    He spake and sat; when Atreus' son arose,
  The Hero Agamemnon, throned supreme.
  Tempests of black resentment overcharged                       125
  His heart, and indignation fired his eyes.
  On Calchas lowering, him he first address'd.
    Prophet of mischief! from whose tongue no note
  Of grateful sound to me, was ever heard;
  Ill tidings are thy joy, and tidings glad                      130
  Thou tell'st not, or thy words come not to pass.
  And now among the Danaรฏ thy dreams
  Divulging, thou pretend'st the Archer-God
  For his priest's sake, our enemy, because
  I scorn'd his offer'd ransom of the maid                       135
  Chrysรซis, more desirous far to bear
  Her to my home, for that she charms me more
  Than Clytemnestra, my own first espoused,
  With whom, in disposition, feature, form,
  Accomplishments, she may be well compared.                     140
  Yet, being such, I will return her hence
  If that she go be best. Perish myself--
  But let the people of my charge be saved
  Prepare ye, therefore, a reward for me,
  And seek it instant. It were much unmeet                       145
  That I alone of all the Argive host
  Should want due recompense, whose former prize
  Is elsewhere destined, as ye all perceive.
    To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.
  Atrides, glorious above all in rank,                           150
  And as intent on gain as thou art great,
  Whence shall the Grecians give a prize to thee?
  The general stock is poor; the spoil of towns
  Which we have taken, hath already passed
  In distribution, and it were unjust                            155
  To gather it from all the Greeks again.
  But send thou back this Virgin to her God,
  And when Jove's favor shall have given us Troy,
  A threefold, fourfold share shall then be thine.
    To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.                   160
  Godlike Achilles, valiant as thou art,
  Wouldst thou be subtle too? But me no fraud
  Shall overreach, or art persuade, of thine.
  Wouldst thou, that thou be recompensed, and I
  Sit meekly down, defrauded of my due?                          165
  And didst thou bid me yield her? Let the bold
  Achaians give me competent amends,
  Such as may please me, and it shall be well.
  Else, if they give me none, I will command
  Thy prize, the prize of Ajax, or the prize                     170
  It may be of Ulysses to my tent,
  And let the loser chafe. But this concern
  Shall be adjusted at convenient time.
  Come--launch we now into the sacred deep
  A bark with lusty rowers well supplied;                        175
  Then put on board Chrysรซis, and with her
  The sacrifice required. Go also one
  High in authority, some counsellor,
  Idomeneus, or Ajax, or thyself,
  Thou most untractable of all mankind;                          180
  And seek by rites of sacrifice and prayer
  To appease Apollo on our host's behalf.
    Achilles eyed him with a frown, and spake.
  Ah! clothed with impudence as with a cloak,
  And full of subtlety, who, thinkest thou--                     185
  What Grecian here will serve thee, or for thee
  Wage covert war, or open? Me thou know'st,
  Troy never wronged; I came not to avenge
  Harm done to me; no Trojan ever drove
  My pastures, steeds or oxen took of mine,                      190
  Or plunder'd of their fruits the golden fields
  Of Phthia[13] the deep-soil'd. She lies remote,
  And obstacles are numerous interposed,
  Vale-darkening mountains, and the dashing sea.
  No, [14]Shameless Wolf! For thy good pleasure's sake           195
  We came, and, [15]Face of flint! to avenge the wrongs
  By Menelaus and thyself sustain'd,
  On the offending Trojan--service kind,
  But lost on thee, regardless of it all.
  And now--What now? Thy threatening is to seize                 200
  Thyself, the just requital of my toils,
  My prize hard-earn'd, by common suffrage mine.
  I never gain, what Trojan town soe'er
  We ransack, half thy booty. The swift march
  And furious onset--these I largely reap,                       205
  But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds
  Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased,
  Bear to my ships the little that I win
  After long battle, and account it much.
  But I am gone, I and my sable barks                            210
  (My wiser course) to Phthia, and I judge,
  Scorn'd as I am, that thou shalt hardly glean
  Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume.[16]
    He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied
  Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel                     215
  Such ardor of desire to go--begone!
  I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour
  On my behalf, for I have others here
  Who will respect me more, and above all
  All-judging Jove. There is not in the host                     220
  King or commander whom I hate as thee,
  For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood,
  And at all times; yet valor is no ground
  Whereon to boast, it is the gift of Heaven
  Go, get ye back to Phthia, thou and thine!                     225
  There rule thy Myrmidons.[17] I need not thee,
  Nor heed thy wrath a jot. But this I say,
  Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize
  Chrysรซis, and I shall return her home
  In mine own bark, and with my proper crew,                     230
  So sure the fair Brisรซis shall be mine.
  I shall demand her even at thy tent.
  So shalt thou well be taught, how high in power
  I soar above thy pitch, and none shall dare
  Attempt, thenceforth, comparison with me.                      235
    He ended, and the big, disdainful heart
  Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued
  And sore perplex'd him, whether forcing wide
  A passage through them, with his blade unsheathed
  To lay Atrides breathless at his foot,                         240
  Or to command his stormy spirit down.
  So doubted he, and undecided yet
  Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo!
  Down sent by Juno, to whom both alike
  Were dear, and who alike watched over both,                    245
  Pallas descended. At his back she stood
  To none apparent, save himself alone,
  And seized his golden locks. Startled, he turned,
  And instant knew Minerva. Flashed her eyes
  Terrific;[18] whom with accents on the wing                    250
  Of haste, incontinent he questioned thus.
    Daughter of Jove, why comest thou? that thyself
  May'st witness these affronts which I endure
  From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak,
  This moment, for his arrogance, he dies.                       255
    To whom the blue-eyed Deity. From heaven
  Mine errand is, to sooth, if thou wilt hear,
  Thine anger. Juno the white-arm'd alike
  To him and thee propitious, bade me down:
  Restrain thy wrath. Draw not thy falchion forth.               260
  Retort, and sharply, and let that suffice.
  For I foretell thee true. Thou shalt receive,
  Some future day, thrice told, thy present loss
  For this day's wrong. Cease, therefore, and be still.
    To whom Achilles. Goddess, although much                     265
  Exasperate, I dare not disregard
  Thy word, which to obey is always best.[19]
  Who hears the Gods, the Gods hear also him.
    He said; and on his silver hilt the force
  Of his broad hand impressing, sent the blade                   270
  Home to its rest, nor would the counsel scorn
  Of Pallas. She to heaven well-pleased return'd,
  And in the mansion of Jove รgis[20]-armed
  Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods.
  But though from violence, yet not from words                   275
  Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt
  Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached.
    Oh charged with wine, in steadfastness of face
  Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer!
  Thou never, when the troops have taken arms,                   280
  Hast dared to take thine also; never thou
  Associate with Achaia's Chiefs, to form
  The secret ambush.[21] No. The sound of war
  Is as the voice of destiny to thee.
  Doubtless the course is safer far, to range                    285
  Our numerous host, and if a man have dared
  Dispute thy will, to rob him of his prize.
  King! over whom? Women and spiritless--
  Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves
  Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more.            290
  But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath.
  By this same sceptre,[22] which shall never bud,
  Nor boughs bring forth as once, which having left
  Its stock on the high mountains, at what time
  The woodman's axe lopped off its foliage green,                295
  And stript its bark, shall never grow again;
  Which now the judges of Achaia bear,
  Who under Jove, stand guardians of the laws,
  By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath)
  Time shall be, when Achilles shall be missed;                  300
  When all shall want him, and thyself the power
  To help the Achaians, whatsoe'er thy will;
  When Hector at your heels shall mow you down:
  The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul,
  Vexation-stung, shall tear thee with remorse,                  305
  That thou hast scorn'd, as he were nothing worth,
  A Chief, the soul and bulwark of your cause.
    So saying, he cast his sceptre on the ground
  Studded with gold, and sat. On the other side
  The son of Atreus all impassion'd stood,                       310
  When the harmonious orator arose
  Nestor, the Pylian oracle, whose lips
  Dropped eloquence--the honey not so sweet.
  Two generations past of mortals born
  In Pylus, coรซtaneous with himself,                             315
  He govern'd now the third--amid them all
  He stood, and thus, benevolent, began.
    Ah! what calamity hath fall'n on Greece!
  Now Priam and his sons may well exult,
  Now all in Ilium shall have joy of heart                       320
  Abundant, hearing of this broil, the prime
  Of Greece between, in council and in arms.
  But be persuaded; ye are younger both
  Than I, and I was conversant of old
  With Princes your superiors, yet from them                     325
  No disrespect at any time received.
  Their equals saw I never; never shall;
  Exadius, Coeneus, and the Godlike son
  Of รgeus, mighty Theseus; men renown'd
  For force superior to the race of man,                         330
  Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought,
  With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights
  The Centaurs,[23] whom with havoc such as fame
  Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew.
  With these men I consorted erst, what time                     335
  From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote,
  They called me forth, and such as was my strength,
  With all that strength I served them. Who is he?
  What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race
  Now seen on earth who might with these compare?                340
  Yet even these would listen and conform
  To my advice in consultation given,
  Which hear ye also; for compliance proves
  Oft times the safer and the manlier course.
  Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art,                          345
  Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks,
  But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive
  With our imperial Chief; for never King
  Had equal honor at the hands of Jove
  With Agamemnon, or was throned so high.                        350
  Say thou art stronger, and art Goddess-born,
  How then? His territory passes thine,
  And he is Lord of thousands more than thou.
  Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath;
  And it shall be mine office to entreat                         355
  Achilles also to a calm, whose might
  The chief munition is of all our host.
    To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied,
  The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well,
  Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here--                360
  Nought will suffice him but the highest place:
  He must control us all, reign over all,
  Dictate to all; but he shall find at least
  One here, disposed to question his commands.
  If the eternal Gods have made him brave,                       365
  Derives he thence a privilege to rail?
    Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce.
  Could I be found so abject as to take
  The measure of my doings at thy lips,
  Well might they call me coward through the camp,               370
  A vassal, and a fellow of no worth.
  Give law to others. Think not to control
  Me, subject to thy proud commands no more.
  Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear.
  I will not strive with thee in such a cause,                   375
  Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight
  For her, whom having given, ye take away.
  But I have other precious things on board;
  Of those take none away without my leave.
  Or if it please thee, put me to the proof                      380
  Before this whole assembly, and my spear
  Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood.
    Thus they long time in opposition fierce
  Maintained the war of words; and now, at length,
  (The grand consult dissolved,) Achilles walked                 385
  (Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps
  Attending) to his camp and to his fleet.
  But Agamemnon order'd forth a bark,
  A swift one, manned with twice ten lusty rowers;
  He sent on board the Hecatomb:[24] he placed                   390
  Chrysรซis with the blooming cheeks, himself,
  And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge.
  So all embarked, and plow'd their watery way.
  Atrides, next, bade purify the host;
  The host was purified, as he enjoin'd,                         395
  And the ablution cast into the sea.
    Then to Apollo, on the shore they slew,
  Of the untillable and barren deep,
  Whole Hecatombs of bulls and goats, whose steam
  Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies.                     400
    Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while
  The son of Atreus from his threats denounced
  At first against Achilles, but command
  Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates
  His heralds, ever faithful to his will.                        405
    Haste--Seek ye both the tent of Peleus' son
  Achilles. Thence lead hither by the hand
  Blooming Brisรซis, whom if he withhold,
  Not her alone, but other spoil myself
  Will take in person--He shall rue the hour.                    410
    With such harsh message charged he them dismissed
  They, sad and slow, beside the barren waste
  Of Ocean, to the galleys and the tents
  Moved of the Myrmidons. Him there they found
  Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined,                       415
  Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood,
  In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck,
  Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less
  Knew well their embassy, and thus began.
    Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men,                      420
  Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both.
  I blame not you; the fault is his alone
  Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence
  Brisรซis. Go, Patroclus, generous friend!
  Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid.               425
  But be themselves my witnesses before
  The blessed Gods, before mankind, before
  The ruthless king, should want of me be felt
  To save the host from havoc[25]--Oh, his thoughts
  Are madness all; intelligence or skill,                        430
  Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp
  May be secured from inroad, none hath he.
    He ended, nor Patroclus disobey'd,
  But leading beautiful Brisรซis forth
  Into their guidance gave her; loth she went                    435
  From whom she loved, and looking oft behind.
  Then wept Achilles, and apart from all,
  With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep
  And arms outstretch'd, his mother suppliant sought.
    Since, mother, though ordain'd so soon to die,               440
  I am thy son, I might with cause expect
  Some honor at the Thunderer's hands, but none
  To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief
  Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced,
  Seizing by violence my just reward.                            445
    So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard
  Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat
  Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood
  Ascending sudden, like a mist she came,
  Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.               450
    Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?
  Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share.
    To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied.
  Why tell thee woes to thee already known?
  At Thebes, Eรซtion's city we arrived,                           455
  Smote, sack'd it, and brought all the spoil away.
  Just distribution made among the Greeks,
  The son of Atreus for his lot received
  Blooming Chrysรซis. Her, Apollo's priest
  Old Chryses followed to Achaia's camp,                         460
  That he might loose his daughter. Ransom rich
  He brought, and in his hands the hallow'd wreath
  And golden sceptre of the Archer God
  Apollo, bore; to the whole Grecian host,
  But chiefly to the foremost in command                         465
  He sued, the sons of Atreus; then, the rest
  All recommended reverence of the Seer,
  And prompt acceptance of his costly gifts.
  But Agamemnon might not so be pleased,
  Who gave him rude dismission; he in wrath                      470
  Returning, prayed, whose prayer Apollo heard,
  For much he loved him. A pestiferous shaft
  He instant shot into the Grecian host,
  And heap'd the people died. His arrows swept
  The whole wide camp of Greece, 'till at the last               475
  A Seer, by Phoebus taught, explain'd the cause.
  I first advised propitiation. Rage
  Fired Agamemnon. Rising, he denounced
  Vengeance, and hath fulfilled it. She, in truth,
  Is gone to Chrysa, and with her we send                        480
  Propitiation also to the King
  Shaft-arm'd Apollo. But my beauteous prize
  Brisรซis, mine by the award of all,
  His heralds, at this moment, lead away.
  But thou, wherein thou canst, aid thy own son!                 485
  Haste hence to Heaven, and if thy word or deed
  Hath ever gratified the heart of Jove,
  With earnest suit press him on my behalf.
  For I, not seldom, in my father's hall
  Have heard thee boasting, how when once the Gods,              490
  With Juno, Neptune, Pallas at their head,
  Conspired to bind the Thunderer, thou didst loose
  His bands, O Goddess! calling to his aid
  The Hundred-handed warrior, by the Gods
  Briareus, but by men, รgeon named.[26]                         495
  For he in prowess and in might surpassed
  His father Neptune, who, enthroned sublime,
  Sits second only to Saturnian Jove,
  Elate with glory and joy. Him all the Gods
  Fearing from that bold enterprise abstained.                   500
  Now, therefore, of these things reminding Jove,
  Embrace his knees; entreat him that he give
  The host of Troy his succor, and shut fast
  The routed Grecians, prisoners in the fleet,
  That all may find much solace[27] in their King,               505
  And that the mighty sovereign o'er them all,
  Their Agamemnon, may himself be taught
  His rashness, who hath thus dishonor'd foul
  The life itself, and bulwark of his cause.
    To him, with streaming eyes, Thetis replied.                 510
  Born as thou wast to sorrow, ah, my son!
  Why have I rear'd thee! Would that without tears,
  Or cause for tears (transient as is thy life,
  A little span) thy days might pass at Troy!
  But short and sorrowful the fates ordain                       515
  Thy life, peculiar trouble must be thine,
  Whom, therefore, oh that I had never borne!
  But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown'd,
  I will myself plead for thee in the ear
  Of Jove, the Thunderer. Meantime at thy fleet                  520
  Abiding, let thy wrath against the Greeks
  Still burn, and altogether cease from war.
  For to the banks of the Oceanus,[28]
  Where รthiopia holds a feast to Jove,[29]
  He journey'd yesterday, with whom the Gods                     525
  Went also, and the twelfth day brings them home.
  Then will I to his brazen-floor'd abode,
  That I may clasp his knees, and much misdeem
  Of my endeavor, or my prayer shall speed.
    So saying, she went; but him she left enraged                530
  For fair Brisรซis' sake, forced from his arms
  By stress of power. Meantime Ulysses came
  To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge.
  Arrived within the haven[30] deep, their sails
  Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.                   535
  Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast
  Into its crutch, they briskly push'd to land,
  Heaved anchors out, and moor'd the vessel fast.
  Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach;
  Forth came the victims of Apollo next,                         540
  And, last, Chrysรซis. Her Ulysses led
  Toward the altar, gave her to the arms
  Of her own father, and him thus address'd.
    O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men,
  Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring                545
  A Hecatomb on all our host's behalf
  To Phoebus, hoping to appease the God
  By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire.
    So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy
  Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine                 550
  Magnificent in order due they ranged
  The noble Hecatomb.[31] Each laved his hands
  And took the salted meal, and Chryses made
  His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high.
    God of the silver bow, who with thy power                    555
  Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme
  In Tenedos, and Cilla the divine!
  Thou prov'dst propitious to my first request,
  Hast honor'd me, and punish'd sore the Greeks;
  Hear yet thy servant's prayer; take from their host            560
  At once the loathsome pestilence away!
    So Chryses prayed, whom Phoebus heard well-pleased;
  Then prayed the Grecians also, and with meal
  Sprinkling the victims, their retracted necks
  First pierced, then flay'd them; the disjointed thighs         565
  They, next, invested with the double caul,
  Which with crude slices thin they overspread.
  The priest burned incense, and libation poured
  Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside,
  Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth                   570
  Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed,
  They gave to each his portion of the maw,
  Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits,
  And managing with culinary skill
  The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.                   575
  Their whole task thus accomplish'd, and the board
  Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.
  When neither hunger more nor thirst remained
  Unsatisfied, boys crown'd the beakers high
  With wine delicious, and from right to left                    580
  Distributing the cups, served every guest.
  Thenceforth the youths of the Achaian race
  To song propitiatory gave the day,
  Pรฆans[32] to Phoebus, Archer of the skies,
  Chaunting melodious. Pleased, Apollo heard.                    585
  But, when, the sun descending, darkness fell,
  They on the beach beside their hawsers slept;
  And, when the day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd
  Aurora look'd abroad, then back they steer'd
  To the vast camp. Fair wind, and blowing fresh,                590
  Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast,
  Then spread the unsullied canvas to the gale,
  And the wind filled it. Roared the sable flood
  Around the bark, that ever as she went
  Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away.                 595
  Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of Greece,
  Their galley they updrew sheer o'er the sands
  From the rude surge remote, then propp'd her sides
  With scantlings long,[33] and sought their several tents.
    But Peleus' noble son, the speed-renown'd                    600
  Achilles, he, his well-built bark beside,
  Consumed his hours, nor would in council more,
  Where wise men win distinction, or in fight
  Appear, to sorrow and heart-withering wo
  Abandon'd; though for battle, ardent, still                    605
  He panted, and the shout-resounding field.
  But when the twelfth fair morrow streak'd the East,
  Then all the everlasting Gods to Heaven
  Resorted, with the Thunderer at their head,
  And Thetis, not unmindful of her son,                          610
  Prom the salt flood emerged, seeking betimes
  Olympus and the boundless fields of heaven.
  High, on the topmost eminence sublime
  Of the deep-fork'd Olympian she perceived
  The Thunderer seated, from the Gods apart.                     615
  She sat before him, clasp'd with her left hand
  His knees, her right beneath his chin she placed,
  And thus the King, Saturnian Jove, implored.
    Father of all, by all that I have done
  Or said that ever pleased thee, grant my suit.                 620
  Exalt my son, by destiny short-lived
  Beyond the lot of others. Him with shame
  The King of men hath overwhelm'd, by force
  Usurping his just meed; thou, therefore, Jove,
  Supreme in wisdom, honor him, and give                         625
  Success to Troy, till all Achaia's sons
  Shall yield him honor more than he hath lost!
    She spake, to whom the Thunderer nought replied,
  But silent sat long time. She, as her hand
  Had grown there, still importunate, his knees                  630
  Clasp'd as at first, and thus her suit renew'd.[34]
    Or grant my prayer, and ratify the grant,
  Or send me hence (for thou hast none to fear)
  Plainly refused; that I may know and feel
  By how much I am least of all in heaven.                       635
    To whom the cloud-assembler at the last
  Spake, deep-distress'd. Hard task and full of strife
  Thou hast enjoined me; Juno will not spare
  For gibe and taunt injurious, whose complaint
  Sounds daily in the ears of all the Gods,                      640
  That I assist the Trojans; but depart,
  Lest she observe thee; my concern shall be
  How best I may perform thy full desire.
  And to assure thee more, I give the sign
  Indubitable, which all fear expels                             645
  At once from heavenly minds. Nought, so confirmed,
  May, after, be reversed or render'd vain.
    He ceased, and under his dark brows the nod
  Vouchsafed of confirmation. All around
  The Sovereign's everlasting head his curls                     650
  Ambrosial shook,[35] and the huge mountain reeled.
    Their conference closed, they parted. She, at once,
  From bright Olympus plunged into the flood
  Profound, and Jove to his own courts withdrew.
  Together all the Gods, at his approach,                        655
  Uprose; none sat expectant till he came,
  But all advanced to meet the Eternal Sire.
  So on his throne he sat. Nor Juno him
  Not understood; she, watchful, had observed,
  In consultation close with Jove engaged                        660
  Thetis, bright-footed daughter of the deep,
  And keen the son of Saturn thus reproved.
    Shrewd as thou art, who now hath had thine ear?
  Thy joy is ever such, from me apart
  To plan and plot clandestine, and thy thoughts,                665
  Think what thou may'st, are always barred to me.
    To whom the father, thus, of heaven and earth.
  Expect not, Juno, that thou shalt partake
  My counsels at all times, which oft in height
  And depth, thy comprehension far exceed,                       670
  Jove's consort as thou art. When aught occurs
  Meet for thine ear, to none will I impart
  Of Gods or men more free than to thyself.
  But for my secret thoughts, which I withhold
  From all in heaven beside, them search not thou                675
  With irksome curiosity and vain.
    Him answer'd then the Goddess ample-eyed.[36]
  What word hath passed thy lips, Saturnian Jove,
  Thou most severe! I never search thy thoughts,
  Nor the serenity of thy profound                               680
  Intentions trouble; they are safe from me:
  But now there seems a cause. Deeply I dread
  Lest Thetis, silver-footed daughter fair
  Of Ocean's hoary Sovereign, here arrived
  At early dawn to practise on thee, Jove!                       685
  I noticed her a suitress at thy knees,
  And much misdeem or promise-bound thou stand'st
  To Thetis past recall, to exalt her son,
  And Greeks to slaughter thousands at the ships.
    To whom the cloud-assembler God, incensed.                   690
  Ah subtle! ever teeming with surmise,
  And fathomer of my concealed designs,
  Thy toil is vain, or (which is worse for thee,)
  Shall but estrange thee from mine heart the more.
  And be it as thou sayest,--I am well pleased                   695
  That so it should be. Be advised, desist,
  Hold thou thy peace. Else, if my glorious hands
  Once reach thee, the Olympian Powers combined
  To rescue thee, shall interfere in vain.
    He said,--whom Juno, awful Goddess, heard                    700
  Appall'd, and mute submitted to his will.
  But through the courts of Jove the heavenly Powers
  All felt displeasure; when to them arose
  Vulcan, illustrious artist, who with speech
  Conciliatory interposed to sooth                               705
  His white-armed mother Juno, Goddess dread.
    Hard doom is ours, and not to be endured,
  If feast and merriment must pause in heaven
  While ye such clamor raise tumultuous here
  For man's unworthy sake: yet thus we speed                     710
  Ever, when evil overpoises good.
  But I exhort my mother, though herself
  Already warn'd, that meekly she submit
  To Jove our father, lest our father chide
  More roughly, and confusion mar the feast.                     715
  For the Olympian Thunderer could with ease
  Us from our thrones precipitate, so far
  He reigns to all superior. Seek to assuage
  His anger therefore; so shall he with smiles
  Cheer thee, nor thee alone, but all in heaven.                 720
    So Vulcan, and, upstarting, placed a cup
  Full-charged between his mother's hands, and said,
    My mother, be advised, and, though aggrieved,
  Yet patient; lest I see thee whom I love
  So dear, with stripes chastised before my face,                725
  Willing, but impotent to give thee aid.[37]
  Who can resist the Thunderer? Me, when once
  I flew to save thee, by the foot he seized
  And hurl'd me through the portal of the skies.
  "From morn to eve I fell, a summer's day,"                     730
  And dropped, at last, in Lemnos. There half-dead
  The Sintians found me, and with succor prompt
  And hospitable, entertained me fallen.
    So He; then Juno smiled, Goddess white-arm'd,
  And smiling still, from his unwonted hand[38]                  735
  Received the goblet. He from right to left
  Rich nectar from the beaker drawn, alert
  Distributed to all the powers divine.
  Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable
  Peal after peal, such pleasure all conceived                   740
  At sight of Vulcan in his new employ.
    So spent they in festivity the day,
  And all were cheered; nor was Apollo's harp
  Silent, nor did the Muses spare to add
  Responsive melody of vocal sweets.                             745
  But when the sun's bright orb had now declined,
  Each to his mansion, wheresoever built
  By the lame matchless Architect, withdrew.[39]
  Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven,
  His couch ascending as at other times                          750
  When gentle sleep approach'd him, slept serene,
  With golden-sceptred Juno at his side.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of
serious action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his
captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the
pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence.
Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of
Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the
Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his
promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of
the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the
discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this
book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and
happily adapted to the nature of the subject.--FELTON.




                              THE ILIAD.

                               BOOK II.




                     ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK.


Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in
answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in
consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the
army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised
by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and
preparation is made for battle. An exact account follows of the forces
on both sides.




                               BOOK II.


  [1]All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept,
  But not the Sire of all. He, waking soon,
  Mused how to exalt Achilles, and destroy
  No few in battle at the Grecian fleet.
  This counsel, at the last, as best he chose                      5
  And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream
  To Agamemnon's tent, and to his side
  The phantom summoning, him thus addressed.
    Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet,
  And, entering royal Agamemnon's tent,                           10
  His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought
  Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm
  His universal host, for that the time
  When the Achaians shall at length possess
  Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above                        15
  No longer dwell at variance. The request
  Of Juno hath prevail'd; now, wo to Troy!
  So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships
  Well-built arriving of Achaia's host,
  He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought.                            20
  Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed
  In soft repose ambrosial. At his head
  The shadow stood, similitude exact
  Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom
  In Agamemnon's thought might none compare.                      25
  His form assumed, the sacred Dream began.
    Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms
  And in the race! Sleep'st thou? It ill behoves
  To sleep all night the man of high employ,
  And charged, as thou art, with a people's care.                 30
  Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,
  Inform thee, that although so far remote,
  He yet compassionates and thinks on thee
  With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm
  Thy universal host, for that the time                           35
  When the Achaians shall at length possess
  Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above
  No longer dwell at variance. The requests
  Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy
  From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.                     40
  Awaking from thy dewy slumbers, hold
  In firm remembrance all that thou hast heard.
    So spake the Dream, and vanishing, him left
  In false hopes occupied and musings vain.
  Full sure he thought, ignorant of the plan                      45
  By Jove design'd, that day the last of Troy.
  Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks
  And Trojans both, in many a bloody field
  To be endured, the Thunderer yet ordain'd.
  Starting he woke, and seeming still to hear                     50
  The warning voice divine, with hasty leap
  Sprang from his bed, and sat.[2] His fleecy vest
  New-woven he put on, and mantle wide;
  His sandals fair to his unsullied feet
  He braced, and slung his argent-studded sword.                  55
  Then, incorruptible for evermore
  The sceptre of his sires he took, with which
  He issued forth into the camp of Greece.
    Aurora now on the Olympian heights
  Proclaiming stood new day to all in heaven,                     60
  When he his clear-voiced heralds bade convene
  The Greeks in council. Went the summons forth
  Into all quarters, and the throng began.
  First, at the ship of Nestor, Pylian King,[3]
  The senior Chiefs for high exploits renown'd                    65
  He gather'd, whom he prudent thus address'd.
    My fellow warriors, hear! A dream from heaven,
  Amid the stillness of the vacant night
  Approach'd me, semblance close in stature, bulk,
  And air, of noble Nestor. At mine head                          70
  The shadow took his stand, and thus he spake.
    Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms
  And in the race, sleep'st thou? It ill behoves
  To sleep all night the man of high employ,
  And charged as thou art with a people's care.                   75
  Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,
  Inform thee, that although so far remote,
  He yet compassionates and thinks on thee
  With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm
  Thy universal host; for that the time                           80
  When the Achaians shall at length possess
  Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above
  No longer dwell at variance. The requests
  Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy
  From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.                     85
  Charge this on thy remembrance. Thus he spake,
  Then vanished suddenly, and I awoke.
  Haste therefore, let us arm, if arm we may,[4]
  The warlike sons of Greece; but first, myself
  Will prove them, recommending instant flight                    90
  With all our ships, and ye throughout the host
  Dispersed, shall, next, encourage all to stay.
    He ceased, and sat; when in the midst arose
  Of highest fame for wisdom, Nestor, King
  Of sandy Pylus, who them thus bespake.                          95
    Friends, Counsellors, and Leaders of the Greeks!
  Had any meaner Argive told his dream,
  We had pronounced it false, and should the more
  Have shrunk from battle; but the dream is his
  Who boasts himself our highest in command.                     100
  Haste, arm we, if we may, the sons of Greece.
    So saying, he left the council; him, at once
  The sceptred Chiefs, obedient to his voice,
  Arising, follow'd; and the throng began.
  As from the hollow rock bees stream abroad,                    105
  And in succession endless seek the fields,
  Now clustering, and now scattered far and near,
  In spring-time, among all the new-blown flowers,
  So they to council swarm'd, troop after troop,
  Grecians of every tribe, from camp and fleet                   110
  Assembling orderly o'er all the plain
  Beside the shore of Ocean. In the midst
  A kindling rumor, messenger of Jove,
  Impell'd them, and they went. Loud was the din
  Of the assembling thousands; groan'd the earth                 115
  When down they sat, and murmurs ran around.
  Nine heralds cried aloud--Will ye restrain
  Your clamors, that your heaven-taught Kings may speak?
  Scarce were they settled, and the clang had ceased,
  When Agamemnon, sovereign o'er them all,                       120
  Sceptre in hand, arose. (That sceptre erst
  Vulcan with labor forged, and to the hand
  Consign'd it of the King, Saturnian Jove;
  Jove to the vanquisher[5] of Ino's[6] guard,
  And he to Pelops; Pelops in his turn,                          125
  To royal Atreus; Atreus at his death
  Bequeath'd it to Thyestes rich in flocks,
  And rich Thyestes left it to be borne
  By Agamemnon, symbol of his right
  To empire over Argos and her isles)                            130
  On that he lean'd, and rapid, thus began.[7]
    Friends, Grecian Heroes, ministers of Mars!
  Ye see me here entangled in the snares
  Of unpropitious Jove. He promised once,
  And with a nod confirm'd it, that with spoils                  135
  Of Ilium laden, we should hence return;
  But now, devising ill, he sends me shamed,
  And with diminished numbers, home to Greece.
  So stands his sovereign pleasure, who hath laid
  The bulwarks of full many a city low,                          140
  And more shall level, matchless in his might.
  That such a numerous host of Greeks as we,
  Warring with fewer than ourselves, should find
  No fruit of all our toil, (and none appears)
  Will make us vile with ages yet to come.                       145
  For should we now strike truce, till Greece and Troy
  Might number each her own, and were the Greeks
  Distributed in bands, ten Greeks in each,
  Our banded decads should exceed so far
  Their units, that all Troy could not supply                    150
  For every ten, a man, to fill us wine;
  So far the Achaians, in my thought, surpass
  The native Trojans. But in Troy are those
  Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived
  From other states, spear-arm'd auxiliars, firm                 155
  In the defence of Ilium's lofty towers.
  Nine years have passed us over, nine long years;
  Our ships are rotted, and our tackle marr'd,
  And all our wives and little-ones at home
  Sit watching our return, while this attempt                    160
  Hangs still in doubt, for which that home we left.
  Accept ye then my counsel. Fly we swift
  With all our fleet back to our native land,
  Hopeless of Troy, not yet to be subdued.
    So spake the King, whom all the concourse heard              165
  With minds in tumult toss'd; all, save the few,
  Partners of his intent. Commotion shook
  The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood
  Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East
  Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove.                  170
  And as when vehement the West-wind falls
  On standing corn mature, the loaded ears
  Innumerable bow before the gale,
  So was the council shaken. With a shout
  All flew toward the ships; uprais'd, the dust                  175
  Stood o'er them; universal was the cry,
  "Now clear the passages, strike down the props,
  Set every vessel free, launch, and away!"
  Heaven rang with exclamation of the host
  All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet.               180
  Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen
  Returning premature, but Juno thus,
  With admonition quick to Pallas spake.
    Unconquer'd daughter of Jove รgis-arm'd!
  Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last                           185
  That the Achaians on the billows borne,
  Shall seek again their country, leaving here,
  To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,
  Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks
  Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?                 190
  Haste! Seek the mail-arm'd multitude, by force
  Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet
  All launch their oary barks into the flood.
    She spake, nor did Minerva not comply,
  But darting swift from the Olympian heights,                   195
  Reach'd soon Achaia's fleet. There, she perceived
  Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm
  He stood; he touch'd not even with his hand
  His sable bark, for sorrow whelm'd his soul.
  The Athenรฆan Goddess azure-eyed                                200
  Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake.
    Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
  Why seek ye, thus precipitate, your ships?
  Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last,
  That the Achaians on the billows borne,                        205
  Shall seek again their country, leaving here,
  To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,
  Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks
  Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?
  Delay not. Rush into the throng; by force                      210
  Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet
  All launch their oary barks into the flood.
    She ceased, whom by her voice Ulysses knew,
  Casting his mantle from him, which his friend
  Eurybates the Ithacensian caught,                              215
  He ran; and in his course meeting the son
  Of Atreus, Agamemnon, from his hand
  The everlasting sceptre quick received,
  Which bearing, through Achaia's fleet he pass'd.
  What King soever, or distinguish'd Greek                       220
  He found, approaching to his side, in terms
  Of gentle sort he stay'd him. Sir, he cried,
  It is unseemly that a man renown'd
  As thou, should tremble. Go--Resume the seat
  Which thou hast left, and bid the people sit.                  225
  Thou know'st not clearly yet the monarch's mind.
  He proves us now, but soon he will chastize.
  All were not present; few of us have heard
  His speech this day in council. Oh, beware,
  Lest in resentment of this hasty course                        230
  Irregular, he let his anger loose.
  Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns
  By Jove's own ordinance, and is dear to Jove,
    But what plebeian base soe'er he heard
  Stretching his throat to swell the general cry,                235
  He laid the sceptre smartly on his back,
  With reprimand severe. Fellow, he said,
  Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear.
  For who art thou? A dastard and a drone,
  Of none account in council, or in arms.                        240
  By no means may we all alike bear sway
  At Ilium; such plurality of Kings
  Were evil. One suffices. One, to whom
  The son of politic Saturn hath assign'd
  The sceptre, and inforcement of the laws,                      245
  That he may rule us as a monarch ought.[8]
    With such authority the troubled host
  He sway'd; they, quitting camp and fleet again
  Rush'd back to council; deafening was the sound
  As when a billow of the boisterous deep                        250
  Some broad beach dashes, and the Ocean roars.
    The host all seated, and the benches fill'd,
  Thersites only of loquacious tongue
  Ungovern'd, clamor'd mutinous; a wretch
  Of utterance prompt, but in coarse phrase obscene              255
  Deep learn'd alone, with which to slander Kings.
  Might he but set the rabble in a roar,
  He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece
  To Ilium sent, his country's chief reproach.
  Cross-eyed he was, and halting moved on legs                   260
  Ill-pair'd; his gibbous shoulders o'er his breast
  Contracted, pinch'd it; to a peak his head
  Was moulded sharp, and sprinkled thin with hair
  Of starveling length, flimsy and soft as down.
  Achilles and Ulysses had incurr'd                              265
  Most his aversion; them he never spared;
  But now, imperial Agamemnon 'self
  In piercing accents stridulous he charged
  With foul reproach. The Grecians with contempt
  Listen'd, and indignation, while with voice                    270
  At highest pitch, he thus the monarch mock'd.
    What wouldst thou now? Whereof is thy complaint
  Now, Agamemnon? Thou hast fill'd thy tents
  With treasure, and the Grecians, when they take
  A city, choose the loveliest girls for thee.                   275
  Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought
  By some chief Trojan for his son's release
  Whom I, or other valiant Greek may bind?
  Or wouldst thou yet a virgin, one, by right
  Another's claim, but made by force thine own?                  280
  It was not well, great Sir, that thou shouldst bring
  A plague on the Achaians, as of late.
  But come, my Grecian sisters, soldiers named
  Unfitly, of a sex too soft for war,
  Come, let us homeward: let him here digest                     285
  What he shall gorge, alone; that he may learn
  If our assistance profit him or not.
  For when he shamed Achilles, he disgraced
  A Chief far worthier than himself, whose prize
  He now withholds. But tush,--Achilles lacks                    290
  Himself the spirit of a man; no gall
  Hath he within him, or his hand long since
  Had stopp'd that mouth,[9] that it should scoff no more.
    Thus, mocking royal Agamemnon, spake
  Thersites. Instant starting to his side,                       295
  Noble Ulysses with indignant brows
  Survey'd him, and him thus reproved severe.
    Thersites! Railer!--peace. Think not thyself,
  Although thus eloquent, alone exempt
  From obligation not to slander Kings.                          300
  I deem thee most contemptible, the worst
  Of Agamemnon's followers to the war;
  Presume not then to take the names revered
  Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips, to asperse
  Their sacred character, and to appoint                         305
  The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home.
  How soon, how late, with what success at last
  We shall return, we know not: but because
  Achaia's heroes numerous spoils allot
  To Agamemnon, Leader of the host,                              310
  Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King.
  But mark me. If I find thee, as even now,
  Raving and foaming at the lips again,
  May never man behold Ulysses' head
  On these my shoulders more, and may my son                     315
  Prove the begotten of another Sire,
  If I not strip thee to that hide of thine
  As bare as thou wast born, and whip thee hence
  Home to thy galley, sniveling like a boy.
    He ceased, and with his sceptre on the back                  320
  And shoulders smote him. Writhing to and fro,
  He wept profuse, while many a bloody whelk
  Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang.
  Awe-quell'd he sat, and from his visage mean,
  Deep-sighing, wiped the rheums. It was no time                 325
  For mirth, yet mirth illumined every face,
  And laughing, thus they spake. A thousand acts
  Illustrious, both by well-concerted plans
  And prudent disposition of the host
  Ulysses hath achieved, but this by far                         330
  Transcends his former praise, that he hath quell'd
  Such contumelious rhetoric profuse.
  The valiant talker shall not soon, we judge,
  Take liberties with royal names again.[10]
  So spake the multitude. Then, stretching forth                 335
  The sceptre, city-spoiler Chief, arose
  Ulysses. Him beside, herald in form,
  Appeared Minerva. Silence she enjoined
  To all, that all Achaia's sons might hear,
  Foremost and rearmost, and might weigh his words.              340
  He then his counsel, prudent, thus proposed.
    Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek
  To make thee ignominious above all
  In sight of all mankind. None recollects
  His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged,                 345
  Here to abide till Ilium wall'd to heaven
  Should vanquish'd sink, and all her wealth be ours.
  No--now, like widow'd women, or weak boys,
  They whimper to each other, wishing home.
  And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul                       350
  Seems pleasant.[11] The poor seaman from his wife
  One month detain'd, cheerless his ship and sad
  Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts,
  And by the billows of the troubled deep
  Fast lock'd in port. But us the ninth long year                355
  Revolving, finds camp'd under Ilium still.
  I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside
  Their sable barks, the Grecians. Yet the shame
  That must attend us after absence long
  Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?                          360
  Be patient, friends! wait only till we learn
  If Calchas truly prophesied, or not;
  For well we know, and I to all appeal,
  Whom Fate hath not already snatch'd away,
  (It seems but yesterday, or at the most                        365
  A day or two before) that when the ships
  Wo-fraught for Priam, and the race of Troy,
  At Aulis met, and we beside the fount
  With perfect hecatombs the Gods adored
  Beneath the plane-tree, from whose root a stream               370
  Ran crystal-clear, there we beheld a sign
  Wonderful in all eyes. A serpent huge,
  Tremendous spectacle! with crimson spots
  His back all dappled, by Olympian Jove
  Himself protruded, from the altar's foot                       375
  Slipp'd into light, and glided to the tree.
  There on the topmost bough, close-cover'd sat
  With foliage broad, eight sparrows, younglings all,
  Then newly feather'd, with their dam, the ninth.
  The little ones lamenting shrill he gorged,                    380
  While, wheeling o'er his head, with screams the dam
  Bewail'd her darling brood. Her also next,
  Hovering and clamoring, he by the wing
  Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured.
  All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam,                     385
  The God who sent him, signalized him too,
  For him Saturnian Jove transform'd to stone.
  We wondering stood, to see that strange portent
  Intrude itself into our holy rites,
  When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain'd.                390
    Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish'd? Ye behold
  A prodigy by Jove himself produced,
  An omen, whose accomplishment indeed
  Is distant, but whose fame shall never die.[12]
  E'en as this serpent in your sight devour'd                    395
  Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth,
  So we nine years must war on yonder plain,
  And in the tenth, wide-bulwark'd Troy is ours.
    So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done.
  Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence                  400
  Till Priam's spacious city be your prize.
    He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all
  The hollow ships the deafening roar return'd
  Of acclamation, every voice the speech
  Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief.                          405
    Then Nestor the Gerenian,[13] warrior old,
  Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said,
  Ye more resemble children inexpert
  In war, than disciplined and prudent men.
  Where now are all your promises and vows,                      410
  Councils, libations, right-hand covenants?[14]
  Burn them, since all our occupation here
  Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end
  Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found.
  But, Sovereign, be not thou appall'd. Be firm.                 415
  Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway,
  But set the battle forth as thou art wont.
  And if there be a Grecian, here and there,
  One,[15] adverse to the general voice, let such
  Wither alone. He shall not see his wish                        420
  Gratified, neither will we hence return
  To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved
  Jove's promise false or true. For when we climb'd
  Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium's fate,
  Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day,                           425
  (Omen propitious!) thunder'd on the right.
  Let no man therefore pant for home, till each
  Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips
  Take sweet revenge for Helen's pangs of heart.
  Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs                    430
  To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand
  On his own vessel, and he dies the first.
  But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course
  Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks
  By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe               435
  Support, and each his fellow. This performed,
  And with consent of all, thou shalt discern
  With ease what Chief, what private man deserts,
  And who performs his part. The base, the brave,
  Such disposition made, shall both appear;                      440
  And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we,
  The Gods, or our supineness, succor Troy.
    To whom Atrides, King of men, replied.
  Old Chief! Thou passest all Achaia's sons
  In consultation; would to Jove our Sire,                       445
  To Athenรฆan Pallas, and Apollo!
  That I had ten such coadjutors, wise
  As thou art, and the royal city soon
  Of Priam, with her wealth, should all be ours.[16]
  But me the son of Saturn, Jove supreme                         450
  Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils
  Involves me, and in altercation vain.
  Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl
  Achilles and myself between, and I
  The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal'd!               455
  And Troy's reprieve thenceforth is at an end.
  Go--take refreshment now that we may march
  Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well
  His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk
  High-mettled horses, well survey and search                    460
  His chariot on all sides, that no defect
  Disgrace his bright habiliments of war.
  So will we give the day from morn to eve
  To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none
  Till night divide us. Every buckler's thong                    465
  Shall sweat on the toil'd bosom, every hand
  That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed
  Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o'er the plain.
  Wo then to whom I shall discover here
  Loitering among the tents; let him escape                      470
  My vengeance if he can. The vulture's maw
  Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones.
    He spake; whom all applauded with a shout
  Loud as against some headland cliff the waves
  Roll'd by the stormy South o'er rocks that shoot               475
  Afar into the deep, which in all winds
  The flood still overspreads, blow whence they may.
  Arising, forth they rush'd, among the ships
  All scatter'd; smoke from every tent arose,
  The host their food preparing; next, his God                   480
  Each man invoked (of the Immortals him
  Whom he preferr'd) with sacrifice and prayer
  For safe escape from danger and from death.
  But Agamemnon to Saturnian Jove
  Omnipotent, an ox of the fifth year                            485
  Full-flesh'd devoted, and the Princes call'd
  Noblest of all the Grecians to his feast.
  First, Nestor with Idomeneus the King,
  Then either Ajax, and the son he call'd
  Of Tydeus, with Ulysses sixth and last,                        490
  Jove's peer in wisdom. Menelaus went,
  Heroic Chief! unbidden, for he knew
  His brother's mind with weight of care oppress'd.
  The ox encircling, and their hands with meal
  Of consecration fill'd, the assembly stood,                    495
  When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred.
    Almighty Father! Glorious above all!
  Cloud-girt, who dwell'st in heaven thy throne sublime,
  Let not the sun go down, till Priam's roof
  Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn                   500
  His gates with fire; till I shall hew away
  His hack'd and riven corslet from the breast
  Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends,
  Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground.
    So prayed he, but with none effect, The God                  505
  Received his offering, but to double toil
  Doom'd them, and sorrow more than all the past.
    They then, the triturated barley grain
  First duly sprinkling, the sharp steel infix'd
  Deep in the victim's neck reversed, then stripp'd              510
  The carcase, and divided at their joint
  The thighs, which in the double caul involved
  They spread with slices crude, and burn'd with fire
  Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry.
  The spitted entrails next they o'er the coals                  515
  Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed,
  They gave to each his portion of the maw,
  Then slash'd the remnant, pierced it with the spits,
  And managing with culinary skill
  The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.                   520
  Thus, all their task accomplished, and the board
  Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.
  When neither hunger more nor thirst remain'd
  Unsatisfied, Gerenian Nestor spake.
    Atrides! Agamemnon! King of men!                             525
  No longer waste we time in useless words,
  Nor to a distant hour postpone the work
  To which heaven calls thee. Send thine heralds forth.
  Who shall convene the Achaians at the fleet,
  That we, the Chiefs assembled here, may range,                 530
  Together, the imbattled multitude,
  And edge their spirits for immediate fight.
    He spake, nor Agamemnon not complied.
  At once he bade his clear-voiced heralds call
  The Greeks to battle. They the summons loud                    535
  Gave forth, and at the sound the people throng'd.
  Then Agamemnon and the Kings of Greece
  Dispatchful drew them into order just,
  With whom Minerva azure-eyed advanced,
  The inestimable รgis on her arm,                               540
  Immortal, unobnoxious to decay
  A hundred braids, close twisted, all of gold,
  Each valued at a hundred beeves,[17] around
  Dependent fringed it. She from side to side
  Her eyes cerulean rolled, infusing thirst                      545
  Of battle endless into every breast.
  War won them now, war sweeter now to each
  Than gales to waft them over ocean home.[18]
  As when devouring flames some forest seize
  On the high mountains, splendid from afar                      550
  The blaze appears, so, moving on the plain,
  The steel-clad host innumerous flash'd to heaven.
  And as a multitude of fowls in flocks
  Assembled various, geese, or cranes, or swans
  Lithe-neck'd, long hovering o'er Caรฟster's banks               555
  On wanton plumes, successive on the mead
  Alight at last, and with a clang so loud
  That all the hollow vale of Asius rings;
  In number such from ships and tents effused,
  They cover'd the Scamandrian plain; the earth                  560
  Rebellow'd to the feet of steeds and men.
  They overspread Scamander's grassy vale,
  Myriads, as leaves, or as the flowers of spring.
  As in the hovel where the peasant milks
  His kine in spring-time, when his pails are fill'd,            565
  Thick clouds of humming insects on the wing
  Swarm all around him, so the Grecians swarm'd
  An unsumm'd multitude o'er all the plain,
  Bright arm'd, high crested, and athirst for war.
  As goat-herds separate their numerous flocks                   570
  With ease, though fed promiscuous, with like ease
  Their leaders them on every side reduced
  To martial order glorious;[19] among whom
  Stood Agamemnon "with an eye like Jove's,
  To threaten or command," like Mars in girth,                   575
  And with the port of Neptune. As the bull
  Conspicuous among all the herd appears,
  For he surpasses all, such Jove ordain'd
  That day the son of Atreus, in the midst
  Of Heroes, eminent above them all.                             580
    Tell me, (for ye are are heavenly, and beheld[20]
  A scene, whereof the faint report alone
  Hath reached our ears, remote and ill-informed,)
  Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath
  What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note                        585
  Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large;
  _They_ were a multitude in number more
  Than with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth
  Made vocal with a trumpet's throat of brass
  I might declare, unless the Olympian nine,                     590
  Jove's daughters, would the chronicle themselves
  Indite, of all assembled, under Troy.
  I will rehearse the Captains and their fleets.
    [21]Boeotia's sturdy sons Peneleus led,
  And Leรฏtus, whose partners in command                          595
  Arcesilaus and Prothoenor came,
  And Clonius. Them the dwellers on the rocks
  Of Aulis followed, with the hardy clans
  Of Hyrie, Schoenos, Scholos, and the hills
  Of Eteon; Thespia, Grรฆa, and the plains                        600
  Of Mycalessus them, and Harma served,
  Eleon, Erythrรฆ, Peteon; Hyle them,
  Hesius and Ocalea, and the strength
  Of Medeon; Copรฆ also in their train
  Marched, with Eutresis and the mighty men                      605
  Of Thisbe famed for doves; nor pass unnamed
  Whom Coronรฆa, and the grassy land
  Of Haliartus added to the war,
  Nor whom Platรฆa, nor whom Glissa bred,
  And Hypothebรฆ,[22] and thy sacred groves                       610
  To Neptune, dark Onchestus. Arne claims
  A record next for her illustrious sons,
  Vine-bearing Arne. Thou wast also there
  Mideia, and thou Nissa; nor be thine
  Though last, Anthedon, a forgotten name.                       615
  These in Boeotia's fair and gallant fleet
  Of fifty ships, each bearing o'er the waves
  Thrice forty warriors, had arrived at Troy.
    In thirty ships deep-laden with the brave,
  Aspledon and Orchomenos had sent                               620
  Their chosen youth; them ruled a noble pair,
  Sons of Astyoche; she, lovely nymph,
  Received by stealth, on Actor's stately roof,
  The embraces of a God, and bore to Mars
  Twins like himself, Ascalaphus the bold,                       625
  And bold Iรคlmenus, expert in arms.
    Beneath Epistrophus and Schedius, took
  Their destined station on Boeotia's left,
  The brave Phocensians; they in forty ships
  From Cyparissus came, and from the rocks                       630
  Of Python, and from Crissa the divine;
  From Anemoria, Daulis, Panopeus,
  And from Hyampolis, and from the banks
  Of the Cephissus, sacred stream, and from
  Lilรฆa, seated at its fountain-head.                            635
    Next from beyond Euboea's happy isle
  In forty ships conveyed, stood forth well armed
  The Locrians; dwellers in Augeia some
  The pleasant, some of Opoรซis possessed,
  Some of Calliarus; these Scarpha sent,                         640
  And Cynus those; from Bessa came the rest,
  From Tarpha, Thronius, and from the brink
  Of loud Boagrius; Ajax them, the swift,
  Son of Oรฏleus led, not such as he
  From Telamon, big-boned and lofty built,                       645
  But small of limb, and of an humbler crest;
  Yet he, competitor had none throughout
  The Grecians of what land soe'er, for skill
  In ushering to its mark the rapid lance.
    Elphenor brought (Calchodon's mighty son)                    650
  The Euboeans to the field. In forty ships
  From Histrรฏรฆa for her vintage famed,
  From Chalcis, from Iretria, from the gates
  Of maritime Cerinthus, from the heights
  Of Dios rock-built citadel sublime,                            655
  And from Caristus and from Styra came
  His warlike multitudes, all named alike
  Abantes, on whose shoulders fell behind
  Their locks profuse,[23] and they were eager all
  To split the hauberk with the pointed spear.                   660
    Nor Athens had withheld her generous sons,
  The people of Erectheus. Him of old
  The teeming glebe produced, a wondrous birth!
  And Pallas rear'd him: her own unctuous fane
  She made his habitation, where with bulls                      665
  The youth of Athens, and with slaughter'd lambs
  Her annual worship celebrate. Then led
  Menestheus, whom, (sage Nestor's self except,
  Thrice school'd in all events of human life,)
  None rivall'd ever in the just array                           670
  Of horse and man to battle. Fifty ships
  Black-prowed, had borne them to the distant war.
    Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels brought,
  And where the Athenian band in phalanx stood
  Marshall'd compact, there station'd he his powers.             675
    The men of Argos and Tyrintha next,
  And of Hermione, that stands retired
  With Asine, within her spacious bay;
  Of Epidaurus, crown'd with purple vines,
  And of Troezena, with the Achaian youth                        680
  Of sea-begirt รgina, and with thine,
  Maseta, and the dwellers on thy coast,
  Wave-worn Eรฏonรฆ; these all obeyed
  The dauntless Hero Diomede, whom served
  Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, a Chief                            685
  Of deathless fame, his second in command,
  And godlike man, Euryalus, the son
  Of King Mecisteus, Talaรผs' son, his third.
  But Diomede controll'd them all, and him
  Twice forty sable ships their leader own'd.                    690
    Came Agamemnon with a hundred ships,
  Exulting in his powers; more numerous they,
  And more illustrious far than other Chief
  Could boast, whoever. Clad in burnish'd brass,
  And conscious of pre-eminence, he stood.                       695
  He drew his host from cities far renown'd,
  Mycenรฆ, and Corinthus, seat of wealth,
  Orneia, and Cleonรฆ bulwark'd strong,
  And lovely Arรฆthyria; Sicyon, where
  His seat of royal power held at the first                      700
  Adrastus: Hyperesia, and the heights
  Of Gonoรซssa; รgium, with the towns
  That sprinkle all that far-extended coast,
  Pellene also and wide Helice
  With all their shores, were number'd in his train.             705
    From hollow Lacedรฆmon's glen profound,
  From Phare, Sparta, and from Messa, still
  Resounding with the ring-dove's amorous moan,
  From Brysia, from Augeia, from the rocks
  Of Laas, from Amycla, Otilus,                                  710
  And from the towers of Helos, at whose foot
  The surf of Ocean falls, came sixty barks
  With Menelaus. From the monarch's host
  The royal brother ranged his own apart,
  and panted for revenge of Helen's wrongs,                      715
  And of her sighs and tears.[24] From rank to rank,
  Conscious of dauntless might he pass'd, and sent
  Into all hearts the fervor of his own.
    Gerenian Nestor in thrice thirty ships
  Had brought his warriors; they from Pylus came,                720
  From blithe Arene, and from Thryos, built
  Fast by the fords of Alpheus, and from steep
  And stately รpy. Their confederate powers
  Sent Amphigenia, Cyparissa veiled
  With broad redundance of funereal shades,                      725
  Pteleos and Helos, and of deathless fame
  Dorion. In Dorion erst the Muses met
  Threรฏcian Thamyris, on his return
  From Eurytus, Oechalian Chief, and hush'd
  His song for ever; for he dared to vaunt                       730
  That he would pass in song even themselves
  The Muses, daughters of Jove รgis-arm'd.
  They therefore, by his boast incensed, the bard
  Struck blind, and from his memory dash'd severe
  All traces of his once celestial strains.                      735
    Arcadia's sons, the dwellers at the foot
  Of mount Cyllene, where รpytus sleeps
  Intomb'd; a generation bold in fight,
  And warriors hand to hand; the valiant men
  Of Pheneus, of Orchomenos by flocks                            740
  Grazed numberless, of Ripe, Stratia, bleak
  Enispe; Mantinea city fair,
  Stymphelus and Parrhasia, and the youth
  Of Tegea; royal Agapenor these,
  Ancรฆus' offspring, had in sixty ships                          745
  To Troy conducted; numerous was the crew,
  And skilled in arms, which every vessel brought,
  And Agamemnon had with barks himself
  Supplied them, for, of inland realms possessed,
  They little heeded maritime employs.[25]                       750
    The dwellers in Buprasium, on the shores
  Of pleasant Elis, and in all the land
  Myrsinus and the Hyrminian plain between,
  The rock Olenian, and the Alysian fount;
  These all obey'd four Chiefs, and galleys ten                  755
  Each Chief commanded, with Epeans filled.
  Amphimachus and Thalpius govern'd these,
  This, son of Cteatus, the other, sprung
  From Eurytus, and both of Actor's house.
  Diores, son of Amarynceus, those                               760
  Led on, and, for his godlike form renown'd,
  Polyxenus was Chieftain o'er the rest,
  Son of Agasthenes, Augeias' son.
    Dulichium, and her sister sacred isles
  The Echinades, whose opposite aspect                           765
  Looks toward Elis o'er the curling waves,
  Sent forth their powers with Meges at their head,
  Brave son of Phyleus, warrior dear to Jove.
  Phyleus in wrath, his father's house renounced,
  And to Dulichium wandering, there abode.                       770
  Twice twenty ships had follow'd Meges forth.
    Ulysses led the Cephallenians bold.
  From Ithaca, and from the lofty woods
  Of Neritus they came, and from the rocks
  Of rude รgilipa. Crocylia these,                               775
  And these Zacynthus own'd; nor yet a few
  From Samos, from Epirus join'd their aid,
  And from the opposite Ionian shore.
  Them, wise as Jove himself, Ulysses led
  In twelve fair ships, with crimson prows adorn'd.              780
    From forty ships, Thoas, Andrรฆmon's son,
  Had landed his รtolians; for extinct
  Was Meleager, and extinct the house
  Of Oeneus all, nor Oeneus self survived;
  To Thoas therefore had รtolia fallen;                          785
  Him Olenos, Pylene, Chalcis served,
  With Pleuro, and the rock-bound Calydon.
    Idomeneus, spear-practised warrior, led
  The numerous Cretans. In twice forty ships
  He brought his powers to Troy. The warlike bands               790
  Of Cnossus, of Gortyna wall'd around,
  Of Lyctus, of Lycastus chalky-white,
  Of Phรฆstus, of Miletus, with the youth
  Of Rhytius him obey'd; nor these were all,
  But others from her hundred cities Crete                       795
  Sent forth, all whom Idomeneus the brave
  Commanded, with Meriones in arms
  Dread as the God of battles blood-imbrued.
    Nine ships Tlepolemus, Herculean-born,
  For courage famed and for superior size,                       800
  Fill'd with his haughty Rhodians. They, in tribes
  Divided, dwelt distinct. Jelyssus these,
  Those Lindus, and the rest the shining soil
  Of white Camirus occupied. Him bore
  To Hercules, (what time he led the nymph                       805
  From Ephyre, and from Sellea's banks,
  After full many a city laid in dust.)
  Astyocheia. In his father's house
  Magnificent, Tlepolemus spear-famed
  Had scarce up-grown to manhood's lusty prime                   810
  When he his father's hoary uncle slew
  Lycimnius, branch of Mars. Then built he ships,
  And, pushing forth to sea, fled from the threats
  Of the whole house of Hercules. Huge toil
  And many woes he suffer'd, till at length                      815
  At Rhodes arriving, in three separate bands
  He spread himself abroad, Much was he loved
  Of all-commanding Jove, who bless'd him there,
  And shower'd abundant riches on them all.
    Nireus of Syma, with three vessels came;                     820
  Nireus, Aglรฆa's offspring, whom she bore
  To Charopus the King; Nireus in form,
  (The faultless son of Peleus sole except,)
  Loveliest of all the Grecians call'd to Troy.
  But he was heartless and his men were few.[26]                 825
    Nisyrus, Casus, Crapathus, and Cos
  Where reign'd Eurypylus, with all the isles
  Calydnรฆ named, under two valiant Chiefs
  Their troops disposed; Phidippus one, and one,
  His brother Antiphus, begotten both                            830
  By Thessalus, whom Hercules begat.
  In thirty ships they sought the shores of Troy.
    The warriors of Pelasgian Argos next,
  Of Alus, and Alope, and who held
  Trechina, Phthia, and for women fair                           835
  Distinguish'd, Hellas; known by various names
  Hellenes, Myrmidons, Achรฆans, them
  In fifty ships embark'd, Achilles ruled.
  But these were deaf to the hoarse-throated war,
  For there was none to draw their battle forth,                 840
  And give them just array. Close in his ships
  Achilles, after loss of the bright-hair'd
  Brisรซis, lay, resentful; her obtained
  Not without labor hard, and after sack
  Of Thebes and of Lyrnessus, where he slew                      845
  Two mighty Chiefs, sons of Evenus both,
  Epistrophus and Mynes, her he mourn'd,
  And for her sake self-prison'd in his fleet
  And idle lay, though soon to rise again.
    From Phylace, and from the flowery fields                    850
  Of Pyrrhasus, a land to Ceres given
  By consecration, and from Iton green,
  Mother of flocks; from Antron by the sea,
  And from the grassy meads of Pteleus, came
  A people, whom while yet he lived, the brave                   855
  Protesilaรผs led; but him the earth
  Now cover'd dark and drear. A wife he left,
  To rend in Phylace her bleeding cheeks,
  And an unfinish'd mansion. First he died
  Of all the Greeks; for as he leap'd to land                    860
  Foremost by far, a Dardan struck him dead.
  Nor had his troops, though filled with deep regret,
  No leader; them Podarces led, a Chief
  Like Mars in battle, brother of the slain,
  But younger born, and from Iphiclus sprung                     865
  Who sprang from Phylacus the rich in flocks.
  But him Protesilaรผs, as in years,
  So also in desert of arms excell'd
  Heroic, whom his host, although they saw
  Podarces at their head, still justly mourn'd;                  870
  For he was fierce in battle, and at Troy
  With forty sable-sided ships arrived.
    Eleven galleys, Pherรฆ on the lake,
  And Boebe, and Iรถlchus, and the vale
  Of Glaphyrรฆ supplied with crews robust                         875
  Under Eumelus; him Alcestis, praised
  For beauty above all her sisters fair,
  In Thessaly to King Admetus bore.
    Methone, and Olizon's craggy coast,
  With Meliboea and Thaumasia sent                               880
  Seven ships; their rowers were good archers all,
  And every vessel dipped into the wave
  Her fifty oars. Them Philoctetes, skill'd
  To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow,
  Commanded; but he suffering anguish keen                       885
  Inflicted by a serpent's venom'd tooth,
  Lay sick in Lemnos; him the Grecians there
  Had left sore-wounded, but were destined soon
  To call to dear remembrance whom they left.
  Meantime, though sorrowing for his sake, his troops            890
  Yet wanted not a chief; them Medon ruled,
  Whom Rhena to the far-famed conqueror bore
  Oรฏleus, fruit of their unsanction'd loves.
    From Tricca, from Ithome rough and rude
  With rocks and glens, and from Oechalia, town                  895
  Of Eurytus Oechalian-born, came forth
  Their warlike youth by Podalirius led
  And by Machaon, healers both expert
  Of all disease, and thirty ships were theirs.
    The men of Ormenus, and from beside                          900
  The fountain Hypereia, from the tops
  Of chalky Titan, and Asteria's band;
  Them ruled Eurypylus, Evรฆmon's son
  Illustrious, whom twice twenty ships obeyed.
    Orthe, Gyrtone, Oloรถsson white,                              905
  Argissa and Helone; they their youth
  Gave to control of Polypoetes, son
  Undaunted of Pirithoรผs, son of Jove.
  Him, to Pirithoรผs, (on the self-same day
  When he the Centaurs punish'd and pursued                      910
  Sheer to รthicรฆ driven from Pelion's heights
  The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore.
  Nor he alone them led. With him was join'd
  Leonteus dauntless warrior, from the bold
  Coronus sprung, who Cรฆneus call'd his sire.                    915
  Twice twenty ships awaited their command.
    Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships
  Led forth; the Enienes him obey'd,
  And the robust Peroebi, warriors bold,
  And dwellers on Dodona's wintry brow.                          920
  To these were join'd who till the pleasant fields
  Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood
  Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores,
  But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows
  Unmixt as oil;[27] for Stygian is his stream,                  925
  And Styx is the inviolable oath.
    Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon's son,
  The active Prothoรผs came. From the green banks
  Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near
  He gather'd, and from Pelion forest-crown'd.                   930
    These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece.
  Say, Muse, who most in personal desert
  Excell'd, and whose were the most warlike steeds
  And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age,
  Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven            935
  And passing far all others, were the mares
  Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills
  The heavenly Archer of the silver bow,
  Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief
  Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound                         940
  Achilles lay; for he was worthier far,
  And more illustrious were the steeds which bore
  The noble son of Peleus; but revenge
  On Agamemnon leader of the host
  Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships                945
  Sharp-keel'd to cut the foaming flood, he lay.
  Meantime, along the margin of the deep
  His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow.
  Or to its mark dispatch'd the quivering lance.
  Beside the chariots stood the unharness'd steeds               950
  Cropping the lotus, or at leisure browsed
  On celery wild, from watery freshes gleaned.
  Beneath the shadow of the sheltering tent
  The chariot stood, while they, the charioteers
  Roam'd here and there the camp, their warlike lord             955
  Regretting sad, and idle for his sake.
    As if a fire had burnt along the ground,
  Such seem'd their march; earth groan'd their steps beneath;
  As when in Arimi, where fame reports
  Typhoรซus stretch'd, the fires of angry Jove                    960
  Down darted, lash the ground, so groan'd the earth
  Beneath them, for they traversed swift the plain.
    And now from Jove, with heavy tidings charged,
  Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came.
  It was the time of council, when the throng                    965
  At Priam's gate assembled, young and old:
  Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven
  Accosted with the voice of Priam's son,
  Polites. He, confiding in his speed
  For sure deliverance, posted was abroad                        970
  On รsyeta's tomb,[28] intent to watch
  When the Achaian host should leave the fleet.
  The Goddess in his form thus them address'd.
    Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore
  Speaking, debating, as if all were peace;                      975
  I have seen many a bright-embattled field,
  But never one so throng'd as this to-day.
  For like the leaves, or like the sands they come
  Swept by the winds, to gird the city round.
    But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort.                     980
  In Priam's spacious city are allies
  Collected numerous, and of nations wide
  Disseminated various are the tongues.
  Let every Chief his proper troop command,
  And marshal his own citizens to war.                           985
    She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent,
  And quick dissolved the council. All took arms.
  Wide flew the gates; forth rush'd the multitude,
  Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose.
  In front of Ilium, distant on the plain,                       990
  Clear all around from all obstruction, stands
  An eminence high-raised, by mortal men
  Call'd Bateia, but the Gods the tomb
  Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight.
  Troy and her aids there set the battle forth.                  995
    Huge Priameian Hector, fierce in arms,
  Led on the Trojans; with whom march'd the most
  And the most valiant, dexterous at the spear.
    รneas, (on the hills of Ida him
  The lovely Venus to Anchises bore,                            1000
  A Goddess by a mortal man embraced)
  Led the Dardanians; but not he alone;
  Archilochus with him and Acamas
  Stood forth, the offspring of Antenor, each,
  And well instructed in all forms of war.                      1005
    Fast by the foot of Ida, where they drank
  The limpid waters of รsepus, dwelt
  The Trojans of Zeleia. Rich were they
  And led by Pandarus, Lycaon's son,
  Whom Phoebus self graced with the bow he bore.                1010
    Apรฆsus, Adrastea, Terie steep,
  And Pitueia--them, Amphius clad
  In mail thick-woven, and Adrastus, ruled.
  They were the sons of the Percosian seer
  Merops, expert in the soothsayers' art                        1015
  Above all other; he his sons forbad
  The bloody fight, but disobedient they
  Still sought it, for their destiny prevailed.
    The warriors of Percote, and who dwelt
  In Practius, in Arisba, city fair,                            1020
  In Sestus, in Abydus, march'd behind
  Princely Hyrtacides; his tawny steeds,
  Strong-built and tall, from Sellcentes' bank
  And from Arisba, had him borne to Troy.
    Hippothous and Pilmus, branch of Mars,                      1025
  Both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, they,
  Forth from Larissa for her fertile soil
  Far-famed, the spear-expert Pelasgians brought.
    The Thracians (all whom Hellespont includes
  Within the banks of his swift-racing tide)                    1030
  Heroic Acamas and Pirous led.
  Euphemus, offspring of Troezenus, son
  Of Jove-protected Ceas, was the Chief
  Whom the spear-arm'd Ciconian band obey'd.
    Pรฆonia's archers follow'd to the field                      1035
  Pyrรฆchmes; they from Amydon remote
  Were drawn, where Axius winds; broad Axius, stream
  Diffused delightful over all the vale.
    Pylรฆmenes, a Chief of giant might
  From the Eneti for forest-mules renowned                      1040
  March'd with his Paphlagonians; dwellers they
  In Sesamus and in Cytorus were,
  And by the stream Parthenius; Cromna these
  Sent forth, and those รgialus on the lip
  And margin of the land, and some, the heights                 1045
  Of Erythini, rugged and abrupt.
    Epistrophus and Odius from the land
  Of Alybe, a region far remote,
  Where veins of silver wind, led to the field
  The Halizonians. With the Mysians came                        1050
  Chromis their Chief, and Ennomus; him skill'd
  In augury, but skill'd in vain, his art
  Saved not, but by รacides[29] the swift,
  With others in the Xanthus[30] slain, he died.
  Ascanius, lovely youth, and Phorcis, led                      1055
  The Phrygians from Ascania far remote,
  Ardent for battle. The Moeonian race,
  (All those who at the foot of Tmolus dwelt,)
  Mesthles and Antiphus, fraternal pair,
  Sons of Pylรฆmenes commanded, both                             1060
  Of the Gygรฆan lake in Lydia born.
    Amphimachus and Nastes led to fight
  The Carians, people of a barbarous speech,[31]
  With the Milesians, and the mountain-race
  Of wood-crown'd Phthira, and who dwelt beside                 1065
  Mรฆander, or on Mycale sublime.
  Them led Amphimachus and Nastes, sons
  Renown'd of Nomion. Like a simple girl
  Came forth Amphimachus with gold bedight,
  But him his trappings from a woful death                      1070
  Saved not, when whirled beneath the bloody tide
  To Peleus' stormy son his spoils he left.
    Sarpedon with the noble Glaucus led
  Their warriors forth from farthest Lycia, where
  Xanthus deep-dimpled rolls his oozy tide.                     1075




                              THE ILIAD.

                              BOOK III.




                     ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK.


The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Grecian Princes.
Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted solemnly by
Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the part of Troy. The
combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom yet Venus rescues.
Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance of the covenant.




                              BOOK III.


  [1]Now marshall'd all beneath their several chiefs,
  With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms,
  The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard
  Along the skies, when from incessant showers
  Escaping, and from winter's cold, the cranes                     5
  Take wing, and over Ocean speed away;[2]
  Wo to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly
  For slaughter of the small Pygmรฆan race.
  Not so the Greeks; they breathing valor came,
  But silent all, and all with faithful hearts                    10
  On succor mutual to the last, resolved.
  As when the south wind wraps the mountain top
  In mist the shepherd's dread, but to the thief
  Than night itself more welcome, and the eye
  Is bounded in its ken to a stone's cast,                        15
  Such from beneath their footsteps dun and dense
  Uprose the dust, for swift they cross the plain.
    When, host to host opposed, full nigh they stood,
  Then Alexander[3] in the Trojan van
  Advanced was seen, all beauteous as a God;                      20
  His leopard's skin, his falchion and his bow
  Hung from his shoulder; bright with heads of brass
  He shook two spears, and challenged to the fight
  The bravest Argives there, defying all.
  Him, striding haughtily his host before                         25
  When Menelaus saw, such joy he felt
  As hunger-pinch'd the lion feels, by chance
  Conducted to some carcase huge, wild goat,
  Or antler'd stag; huntsmen and baying hounds
  Disturb not _him_, he gorges in their sight.                    30
  So Menelaus at the view rejoiced
  Of lovely Alexander, for he hoped
  His punishment at hand. At once, all armed,
  Down from his chariot to the ground he leap'd
    When godlike Paris him in front beheld                        35
  Conspicuous, his heart smote him, and his fate
  Avoiding, far within the lines he shrank.[4]
  As one, who in some woodland height descrying
  A serpent huge, with sudden start recoils,
  His limbs shake under him; with cautious step                   40
  He slow retires; fear blanches cold his cheeks;
  So beauteous Alexander at the sight
  Of Atreus' son dishearten'd sore, the ranks
  Of haughty Trojans enter'd deep again:
  Him Hector eyed, and thus rebuked severe.                       45
    Curst Paris! Fair deceiver! Woman-mad!
  I would to all in heaven that thou hadst died
  Unborn, at least unmated! happier far
  Than here to have incurr'd this public shame!
  Well may the Grecians taunt, and laughing loud,                 50
  Applaud the champion, slow indeed to fight
  And pusillanimous, but wondrous fair.
  Wast thou as timid, tell me, when with those
  Thy loved companions in that famed exploit,
  Thou didst consort with strangers, and convey                   55
  From distant lands a warrior's beauteous bride
  To be thy father's and his people's curse,
  Joy to our foes, but to thyself reproach?
  Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face
  The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief                 60
  Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.
  Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts
  Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought,
  Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust.
  But we are base ourselves, or long ago,                         65
  For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept
  Secure beneath a coverlet[5] of stone.[6]
    Then godlike Alexander thus replied.
  Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe
  Which in the shipwright's hand the naval plank                  70
  Divides resistless, doubling all his force,
  Such is thy dauntless spirit whose reproach
  Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust.
  Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass
  Of golden Venus; man may not reject                             75
  The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow'd,
  Nor follows their beneficence our choice.
  But if thy pleasure be that I engage
  With Menelaus in decision fierce
  Of desperate combat bid the host of Troy                        80
  And bid the Grecians sit; then face to face
  Commit us, in the vacant field between,
  To fight for Helen and for all her wealth.
  Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her
  And hers possess'd shall bear them safe away;                   85
  While ye (peace sworn and firm accord) shall dwell
  At Troy, and these to Argos shall return
  And to Achaia praised for women fair.
    He ceased, whom Hector heard with joy; he moved
  Into the middle space, and with his spear                       90
  Advanced athwart push'd back the Trojan van,
  And all stood fast. Meantime at him the Greeks
  Discharged full volley, showering thick around
  From bow and sling;[7] when with a mighty voice
  Thus Agamemnon, leader of the host.                             95
    Argives! Be still--shoot not, ye sons of Greece!
  Hector bespeaks attention. Hear the Chief!
    He said, at once the Grecians ceased to shoot,
  And all sat silent. Hector then began.
    Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye Greeks mail-arm'd,               100
  While I shall publish in your ears the words
  Of Alexander, author of our strife.
  Trojans, he bids, and Grecians on the field
  Their arms dispose; while he, the hosts between,
  With warlike Menelaus shall in fight                           105
  Contend for Helen, and for all her wealth.
  Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her
  And hers possess'd, shall bear them safe away,
  And oaths of amity shall bind the rest.
    He ceased, and all deep silence held, amazed;                110
  When valiant Menelaus thus began.
    Hear now me also, on whose aching heart
  These woes have heaviest fallen. At last I hope
  Decision near, Trojans and Greeks between,
  For ye have suffer'd in my quarrel much,                       115
  And much by Paris, author of the war.
  Die he who must, and peace be to the rest.
  But ye shall hither bring two lambs, one white,
  The other black;[8] this to the Earth devote,
  That to the Sun. We shall ourselves supply                     120
  A third for Jove. Then bring ye Priam forth,
  Himself to swear the covenant, (for his sons
  Are faithless) lest the oath of Jove be scorn'd.
  Young men are ever of unstable mind;
  But when an elder interferes, he views                         125
  Future and past together, and insures
  The compact, to both parties, uninfringed.
    So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts
  Awaken'd joyful hope that there should end
  War's long calamities. Alighted each,                          130
  And drew his steeds into the lines. The field
  Glitter'd with arms put off, and side by side,
  Ranged orderly, while the interrupted war
  Stood front to front, small interval between.
    Then Hector to the city sent in haste                        135
  Two heralds for the lambs, and to invite
  Priam; while Agamemnon, royal Chief,
  Talthybius to the Grecian fleet dismiss'd
  For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice
  Of noble Agamemnon disobey'd.                                  140
    Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while,
  To Helen came. Laรถdice she seem'd,
  Loveliest of all the daughters of the house
  Of Priam, wedded to Antenor's son,
  King Helicรคon. Her she found within,                           145
  An ample web magnificent she wove,[9]
  Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake
  Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks
  Mail-arm'd, and Trojans of equestrian fame.
  Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address'd.                   150
    Haste, dearest nymph! a wondrous sight behold!
  Greeks brazen-mail'd, and Trojans steed-renown'd.
  So lately on the cruel work of Mars
  Intent and hot for mutual havoc, sit
  Silent; the war hath paused, and on his shield                 155
  Each leans, his long spear planted at his side.
  Paris and Menelaus, warrior bold,
  With quivering lances shall contend for thee,
  And thou art his who conquers; his for ever.
    So saying, the Goddess into Helen's soul                     160
  Sweetest desire infused to see again
  Her former Lord, her parents, and her home.
  At once o'ermantled with her snowy veil
  She started forth, and as she went let fall
  A tender tear; not unaccompanied                               165
  She went, but by two maidens of her train
  Attended, รthra, Pittheus' daughter fair,
  And soft-eyed Clymene. Their hasty steps
  Convey'd them quickly to the Scรฆan gate.
  There Priam, Panthous, Clytius, Lampus sat,                    170
  Thymoetes, Hicetaon, branch of Mars,
  Antenor and Ucalegon the wise,
  All, elders of the people; warriors erst,
  But idle now through age, yet of a voice
  Still indefatigable as the fly's[10]                           175
  Which perch'd among the boughs sends forth at noon
  Through all the grove his slender ditty sweet.
  Such sat those Trojan leaders on the tower,
  Who, soon as Helen on the steps they saw,
  In accents quick, but whisper'd, thus remark'd.                180
    Trojans and Grecians wage, with fair excuse,
  Long war for so much beauty.[11] Oh, how like
  In feature to the Goddesses above!
  Pernicious loveliness! Ah, hence away,
  Resistless as thou art and all divine,                         185
  Nor leave a curse to us, and to our sons.
    So they among themselves; but Priam call'd
  Fair Helen to his side.[12] My daughter dear!
  Come, sit beside me. Thou shalt hence discern
  Thy former Lord, thy kindred and thy friends.                  190
  I charge no blame on thee. The Gods have caused,
  Not thou, this lamentable war to Troy.[13]
  Name to me yon Achaian Chief for bulk
  Conspicuous, and for port. Taller indeed
  I may perceive than he; but with these eyes                    195
  Saw never yet such dignity, and grace.
  Declare his name. Some royal Chief he seems.
    To whom thus Helen, loveliest of her sex,
  My other Sire! by me for ever held
  In reverence, and with filial fear beloved!                    200
  Oh that some cruel death had been my choice,
  Rather than to abandon, as I did,
  All joys domestic, matrimonial bliss,
  Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear,
  A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas!                           205
  Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep.
  But I resolve thee. Thou behold'st the son
  Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king,
  In arms heroic, gracious in the throne,
  And, (though it shame me now to call him such,)                210
  By nuptial ties a brother once to me.
    Then him the ancient King-admiring, said.
  Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth,
  And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host
  So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey!                       215
  To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth,
  I journey'd; many Phrygians there I saw,
  Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers
  Of Otreus and of Mygdon, godlike Chief,
  And on the banks of Sangar's stream encamp'd.                  220
  I march'd among them, chosen in that war
  Ally of Phrygia, and it was her day
  Of conflict with the man-defying race,
  The Amazons; yet multitudes like these
  Thy bright-eyed Greeks, I saw not even there.                  225
    The venerable King observing next
  Ulysses, thus inquired. My child, declare
  Him also. Shorter by the head he seems
  Than Agamemnon, Atreus' mighty son,
  But shoulder'd broader, and of ampler chest;                   230
  He hath disposed his armor on the plain,
  But like a ram, himself the warrior ranks
  Ranges majestic; like a ram full-fleeced
  By numerous sheep encompass'd snowy-white.
    To whom Jove's daughter Helen thus replied.                  235
  In him the son of old Laรซrtes know,
  Ulysses; born in Ithaca the rude,
  But of a piercing wit, and deeply wise.
    Then answer thus, Antenor sage return'd.
  Princess thou hast described him: hither once                  240
  The noble Ithacan, on thy behalf
  Ambassador with Menelaus, came:
  Beneath my roof, with hospitable fare
  Friendly I entertained them. Seeing then
  Occasion opportune, I closely mark'd                           245
  The genius and the talents of the Chiefs,
  And this I noted well; that when they stood
  Amid the assembled counsellors of Troy,
  Then Menelaus his advantage show'd,
  Who by the shoulders overtopp'd his friend.                    250
  But when both sat, Ulysses in his air
  Had more of state and dignity than he.
  In the delivery of a speech address'd
  To the full senate, Menelaus used
  Few words, but to the matter, fitly ranged,                    255
  And with much sweetness utter'd; for in loose
  And idle play of ostentatious terms
  He dealt not, though he were the younger man.
  But when the wise Ulysses from his seat
  Had once arisen, he would his downcast eyes                    260
  So rivet on the earth, and with a hand
  That seem'd untutor'd in its use, so hold
  His sceptre, swaying it to neither side,
  That hadst thou seen him, thou hadst thought him, sure,
  Some chafed and angry idiot, passion-fixt.                     265
  Yet, when at length, the clear and mellow base
  Of his deep voice brake forth, and he let fall
  His chosen words like flakes of feather'd snow,
  None then might match Ulysses; leisure, then,
  Found none to wonder at his noble form.                        270
    The third of whom the venerable king
  Inquired, was Ajax.--Yon Achaian tall,
  Whose head and shoulders tower above the rest,
  And of such bulk prodigious--who is he?
    Him answer'd Helen, loveliest of her sex.                    275
  A bulwark of the Greeks. In him thou seest
  Gigantic Ajax. Opposite appear
  The Cretans, and among the Chiefs of Crete
  stands, like a God, Idomeneus. Him oft
  From Crete arrived, was Menelaรผs wont                          280
  To entertain; and others now I see,
  Achaians, whom I could recall to mind,
  And give to each his name; but two brave youths
  I yet discern not; for equestrian skill
  One famed, and one a boxer never foiled;                       285
  My brothers; born of Leda; sons of Jove;
  Castor and Pollux. Either they abide
  In lovely Sparta still, or if they came,
  Decline the fight, by my disgrace abash'd
  And the reproaches which have fallen on me.[14]                290
    She said; but they already slept inhumed
  In Lacedemon, in their native soil.
    And now the heralds, through the streets of Troy
  Charged with the lambs, and with a goat-skin filled
  With heart-exhilarating wine prepared                          295
  For that divine solemnity, return'd.
  Idรฆus in his hand a beaker bore
  Resplendent, with its fellow cups of gold,
  And thus he summon'd ancient Priam forth.
    Son of Laรถmedon, arise. The Chiefs                           300
  Call thee, the Chiefs of Ilium and of Greece.
  Descend into the plain. We strike a truce,
  And need thine oath to bind it. Paris fights
  With warlike Menelaรผs for his spouse;
  Their spears decide the strife. The conqueror wins             305
  Helen and all her treasures. We, thenceforth,
  (Peace sworn and amity) shall dwell secure
  In Troy, while they to Argos shall return
  And to Achaia praised for women fair.
    He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train              310
  Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey'd.
  First, Priam mounting, backward stretch'd the reins;
  Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through
  The Scรฆan gate they drove into the plain.
  Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy                       315
  They left the chariot, and proceeded both
  Into the interval between the hosts.
  Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose
  All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came
  Conspicuous forward, expediting each                           320
  The ceremonial; they the beaker fill'd
  With wine, and to the hands of all the kings
  Minister'd water. Agamemnon then
  Drawing his dagger which he ever bore
  Appendant to his heavy falchion's sheath,                      325
  Cut off the forelocks of the lambs,[15] of which
  The heralds gave to every Grecian Chief
  A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy.
  Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray'd.
    Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth                  330
  Thine arm omnipotent, o'erruling all,
  And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing Sun,
  Ye Rivers, and thou conscious Earth, and ye
  Who under earth on human kind avenge
  Severe, the guilt of violated oaths,                           335
  Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear!
  Should Paris slay the hero amber-hair'd,
  My brother Menelaรผs, Helen's wealth
  And Helen's self are his, and all our host
  Shall home return to Greece; but should it chance              340
  That Paris fall by Menelaรผs' hand,
  Then Troy shall render back what she detains,
  With such amercement as is meet, a sum
  To be remember'd in all future times.
  Which penalty should Priam and his sons                        345
  Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms
  I will contend for payment of the mulct
  My due, till, satisfied, I close the war.
    He said, and with his ruthless steel the lambs
  Stretch'd panting all, but soon they ceased to pant,           350
  For mortal was the stroke.[16] Then drawing forth
  Wine from the beaker, they with brimming cups
  Hail'd the immortal Gods, and pray'd again,
  And many a Grecian thus and Trojan spake.
    All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,              355
  Whoso shall violate this contract first,
  So be the brains of them and of their sons
  Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth,
  And may their wives bring forth to other men!
    So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose                 360
  Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,
    Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd.
  Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,
  Unable to sustain the sight, my son
  With warlike Menelaรผs match'd in arms.                         365
  Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom
  Of both, this day is preordain'd the last.
    So spake the godlike monarch, and disposed
  Within the royal chariot all the lambs;
  Then, mounting, check'd the reins; Antenor next                370
  Ascended, and to Ilium both return'd.
    First, Hector and Ulysses, noble Chief,
  Measured the ground; then taking lots for proof
  Who of the combatants should foremost hurl
  His spear, they shook them in a brazen casque;                 375
  Meantime the people raised their hands on high,
  And many a Grecian thus and Trojan prayed.
    Jove, Father, who on Ida seated, seest
  And rulest all below, glorious in power!
  Of these two champions, to the drear abodes                    380
  Of Ades him appoint who furnish'd first
  The cause of strife between them, and let peace
  Oath-bound, and amity unite the rest!
    So spake the hosts; then Hector shook the lots,
  Majestic Chief, turning his face aside.                        385
  Forth sprang the lot of Paris. They in ranks
  Sat all, where stood the fiery steeds of each,
  And where his radiant arms lay on the field.
  Illustrious Alexander his bright arms
  Put on, fair Helen's paramour. [17]He clasp'd                  390
  His polish'd greaves with silver studs secured;
  His brother's corselet to his breast he bound,
  Lycaon's, apt to his own shape and size,
  And slung athwart his shoulders, bright emboss'd,
  His brazen sword; his massy buckler broad                      395
  He took, and to his graceful head his casque
  Adjusted elegant, which, as he moved,
  Its bushy crest waved dreadful; last he seized,
  Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear.
  Meantime the hero Menelaรผs made                                400
  Like preparation, and his arms put on.
    When thus, from all the multitude apart,
  Both combatants had arm'd, with eyes that flash'd
  Defiance, to the middle space they strode,
  Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment                       405
  Seized all beholders. On the measured ground
  Full near they stood, each brandishing on high
  His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth.
    First, Alexander his long-shadow'd spear
  Sent forth, and on his smooth shield's surface struck          410
  The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard
  Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point
  Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay'd.
  Then Menelaรผs to the fight advanced
  Impetuous, after prayer offer'd to Jove.[18]                   415
    King over all! now grant me to avenge
  My wrongs on Alexander; now subdue
  The aggressor under me; that men unborn
  May shudder at the thought of faith abused,
  And hospitality with rape repaid.                              420
  He said, and brandishing his massy spear,
  Dismiss'd it. Through the burnish'd buckler broad
  Of Priam's son the stormy weapon flew,
  Transpierced his costly hauberk, and the vest
  Ripp'd on his flank; but with a sideward bend                  425
  He baffled it, and baulk'd the dreadful death.
    Then Menelaรผs drawing his bright blade,
  Swung it aloft, and on the hairy crest
  Smote him; but shiver'd into fragments small
  The falchion at the stroke fell from his hand.                 430
  Vexation fill'd him; to the spacious heavens
  He look'd, and with a voice of wo exclaim'd--
    Jupiter! of all powers by man adored
  To me most adverse! Confident I hoped
  Revenge for Paris' treason, but my sword                       435
  Is shivered, and I sped my spear in vain.
    So saying, he sprang on him, and his long crest
  Seized fast; then, turning, drew him by that hold
  Toward the Grecian host. The broider'd band
  That underbraced his helmet at the chin,                       440
  Strain'd to his smooth neck with a ceaseless force,
  Chok'd him; and now had Menelaus won
  Deathless renown, dragging him off the field,
  But Venus, foam-sprung Goddess, feeling quick
  His peril imminent, snapp'd short the brace                    445
  Though stubborn, by a slaughter'd[19] ox supplied,
  And the void helmet follow'd as he pull'd.
  That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft,
  Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured,
  Then with vindictive strides he rush'd again                   450
  On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved
  In mist opaque Venus with ease divine
  Snatch'd thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill'd
  With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets.
  Nor stay'd the Goddess, but at once in quest                   455
  Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower
  She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy,
  And twitch'd her fragrant robe. In form she seem'd
  An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt
  In Lacedรฆmon, her unsullied wool                               460
  Dress'd for her, faithfullest of all her train.
  Like her disguised the Goddess thus began.
    Haste--Paris calls thee--on his sculptured couch,
  (Sparkling alike his looks and his attire)
  He waits thy wish'd return. Thou wouldst not dream             465
  That he had fought; he rather seems prepared
  For dance, or after dance, for soft repose.
    So saying, she tumult raised in Helen's mind.
  Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck,
  By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes                 470
  She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake.
    Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish
  Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say,
  To some fair city of Mรฆonian name
  Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?                    475
  Hast thou some human favorite also there?
  Is it because Atrides hath prevailed
  To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home
  Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt'st
  Again to cheat me? Go thyself--sit thou                        480
  Beside him--for his sake renounce the skies;
  Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife
  He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave.
  I go not (now to go were shame indeed)
  To dress his couch; nor will I be the jest                     485
  Of all my sex in Ilium. Oh! my griefs
  Are infinite, and more than I can bear.
    To whom, the foam-sprung Goddess, thus incensed.
  Ah wretch! provoke not me; lest in my wrath
  Abandoning thee, I not hate thee less                          490
  Than now I fondly love thee, and beget
  Such detestation of thee in all hearts,
  Grecian and Trojan, that thou die abhorr'd.
    The Goddess ceased. Jove's daughter, Helen, fear'd,
  And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around,                     495
  Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames
  Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way.
  Soon then as Alexander's fair abode
  They reach'd, her maidens quick their tasks resumed,
  And she to her own chamber lofty-roof'd                        500
  Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat
  For Helen, daughter of Jove รgis-arm'd,
  To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles
  Herself disposed; but with averted eyes
  She sat before him, and him keen reproach'd.                   505
    Thou hast escaped.--Ah would that thou hadst died
  By that heroic arm, mine husband's erst!
  Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength
  Superior. Go then--challenge yet again
  The warlike Menelaรผs forth in fight.                           510
  But hold. The hero of the amber locks
  Provoke no more so rashly, lest the point
  Of his victorious spear soon stretch thee dead.
    She ended, to whom Paris thus replied.
  Ah Helen, wound me not with taunt severe!                      515
  Me, Menelaรผs, by Minerva's aid,
  Hath vanquish'd now, who may hereafter, him.
  We also have our Gods. But let us love.
  For never since the day when thee I bore
  From pleasant Lacedรฆmon o'er the waves                         520
  To Cranรคe's fair isle, and first enjoy'd
  Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now,
  Or felt such sweetness of intense desire.
    He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow'd soon
  Jove's daughter, reconciled to his embrace.                    525
    But Menelaรผs like a lion ranged
  The multitude, inquiring far and near
  For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him
  Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love
  None had conceal'd, for him as death itself                    530
  All hated, but his going none had seen.
    Amidst them all then spake the King of men.
  Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy!
  The warlike Menelaรผs hath prevailed,
  As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth                 535
  Helen with all her treasures, also bring
  Such large amercement as is meet, a sum
  To be remember'd in all future times.
    So spake Atrides, and Achaia's host
  With loud applause confirm'd the monarch's claim.              540




                              THE ILIAD.

                               BOOK IV.




                     ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK.


In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and Juno,
which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch Minerva with
a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the truce. Minerva
descends for that purpose, and in the form of Laodocus, a son of
Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus, and succeeds. Menelaus
is wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned him to the care of Machaon,
goes forth to perform the duties of commander-in-chief, in the
encouragement of his host to battle. The battle begins.




                               BOOK IV.


  Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode
  The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them,
  Graceful, with nectar served;[1] they pledging each
  His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold,
  And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy,                 5
  When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech
  Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire.
    Two Goddesses on Menelaus' part
  Confederate stand, Juno in Argos known,
  Pallas in Alalcomene;[2] yet they                               10
  Sequester'd sit, look on, and are amused.
  Not so smile-loving Venus; she, beside
  Her champion station'd, saves him from his fate,
  And at this moment, by her aid, he lives.
  But now, since victory hath proved the lot                      15
  Of warlike Menelaus, weigh ye well
  The matter; shall we yet the ruinous strife
  Prolong between the nations, or consent
  To give them peace? should peace your preference win,
  And prove alike acceptable to all,                              20
  Stand Ilium, and let Menelaus bear
  Helen of Argos back to Greece again.
    He ended; Juno and Minerva heard,
  Low-murmuring deep disgust; for side by side
  They forging sat calamity to Troy.                              25
  Minerva through displeasure against Jove
  Nought utter'd, for with rage her bosom boil'd;
  But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.
    What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe!
  How? wouldst thou render fruitless all my pains?                30
  The sweat that I have pour'd? my steeds themselves
  Have fainted while I gather'd Greece in arms
  For punishment of Priam and his sons.
  Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven.
    Then her the Thunderer answer'd sore displeased.              35
  Ah shameless! how have Priam and his sons
  So much transgress'd against thee, that thou burn'st
  With ceaseless rage to ruin populous Troy?
  Go, make thine entrance at her lofty gates,
  Priam and all his house, and all his host                       40
  Alive devour; then, haply, thou wilt rest;
  Do even as thou wilt, that this dispute
  Live not between us a consuming fire
  For ever. But attend; mark well the word.
  When I shall also doom in future time                           45
  Some city to destruction, dear to thee,
  Oppose me not, but give my fury way
  As I give way to thine, not pleased myself,
  Yet not unsatisfied, so thou be pleased.
  For of all cities of the sons of men,                           50
  And which the sun and stars from heaven behold,
  Me sacred Troy most pleases, Priam me
  Most, and the people of the warrior King.
  Nor without cause. They feed mine altar well;
  Libation there, and steam of savory scent                       55
  Fail not, the tribute which by lot is ours.
    Him answer'd, then, the Goddess ample-eyed,[3]
  Majestic Juno: Three fair cities me,
  Of all the earth, most interest and engage,
  Mycenรฆ for magnificence renown'd,                               60
  Argos, and Sparta. Them, when next thy wrath
  Shall be inflamed against them, lay thou waste;
  I will not interpose on their behalf;
  Thou shalt not hear me murmur; what avail
  Complaint or force against thy matchless arm?                   65
  Yet were it most unmeet that even I
  Should toil in vain; I also boast a birth
  Celestial; Saturn deeply wise, thy Sire,
  Is also mine; our origin is one.
  Thee I acknowledge Sovereign, yet account                       70
  Myself entitled by a twofold claim
  To veneration both from Gods and men,
  The daughter of Jove's sire, and spouse of Jove.
  Concession mutual therefore both thyself
  Befits and me, whom when the Gods perceive                      75
  Disposed to peace, they also shall accord.
  Come then.--To yon dread field dispatch in haste
  Minerva, with command that she incite
  The Trojans first to violate their oath
  By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.                    80
    So Juno; nor the sire of all refused,
  But in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake.
    Begone; swift fly to yonder field; incite
  The Trojans first to violate their oath
  By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.                    85
    The Goddess heard, and what she wish'd, enjoin'd,
  Down-darted swift from the Olympian heights,
  In form a meteor, such as from his hand
  Not seldom Jove dismisses, beaming bright
  And breaking into stars, an omen sent                           90
  To mariners, or to some numerous host.
  Such Pallas seem'd, and swift descending, dropp'd
  Full in the midst between them. They with awe
  That sign portentous and with wonder view'd,
  Achaians both and Trojans, and his next                         95
  The soldier thus bespake. Now either war
  And dire hostility again shall flame,
  Or Jove now gives us peace. Both are from Jove.
    So spake the soldiery; but she the form
  Taking of brave Laodocus, the son                              100
  Of old Antenor, throughout all the ranks
  Sought godlike Pandarus.[4] Ere long she found
  The valiant son illustrious of Lycaon,
  Standing encompass'd by his dauntless troops,
  Broad-shielded warriors, from รsepus' stream                   105
  His followers; to his side the Goddess came,
  And in wing'd accents ardent him bespake.
    Brave offspring of Lycaon, is there hope
  That thou wilt hear my counsel? darest thou slip
  A shaft at Menelaus? much renown                               110
  Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win,
  But most of all, from Paris, prince of Troy.
  From him illustrious gifts thou shalt receive
  Doubtless, when Menelaus he shall see
  The martial son of Atreus by a shaft                           115
  Subdued of thine, placed on his funeral pile.
  Come. Shoot at Menelaus, glorious Chief!
  But vow to Lycian Phoebus bow-renown'd
  A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,
  To fair Zeleia's[5] walls once safe restored.                  120
    So Pallas spake, to whom infatuate he
  Listening, uncased at once his polished bow.[6]
  That bow, the laden brows of a wild goat
  Salacious had supplied; him on a day
  Forth-issuing from his cave, in ambush placed                  125
  He wounded with an arrow to his breast
  Dispatch'd, and on the rock supine he fell.
  Each horn had from his head tall growth attain'd,
  Full sixteen palms; them shaven smooth the smith
  Had aptly join'd, and tipt their points with gold.             130
  That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm
  The nether horn, his comrades bold the while
  Screening him close with shields, lest ere the prince
  Were stricken, Menelaus brave in arms,
  The Greeks with fierce assault should interpose.               135
  He raised his quiver's lid; he chose a dart
  Unflown, full-fledged, and barb'd with pangs of death.
  He lodged in haste the arrow on the string,
  And vow'd to Lycian Phoebus bow-renown'd
  A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,                       140
  To fair Zeleia's walls once safe restored.
  Compressing next nerve and notch'd arrow-head
  He drew back both together, to his pap
  Drew home the nerve, the barb home to his bow,
  And when the horn was curved to a wide arch,                   145
  He twang'd it. Whizz'd the bowstring, and the reed
  Leap'd off, impatient for the distant throng.
    Thee, Menelaus, then the blessed Gods
  Forgat not; Pallas huntress of the spoil,
  Thy guardian then, baffled the cruel dart.                     150
  Far as a mother wafts the fly aside[7]
  That haunts her slumbering babe, so far she drove
  Its course aslant, directing it herself
  Against the golden clasps that join'd his belt;
  For there the doubled hauberk interposed.                      155
  The bitter arrow plunged into his belt.
  It pierced his broider'd belt, stood fixt within
  His twisted hauberk, nor the interior quilt,
  Though penetrable least to arrow-points
  And his best guard, withheld it, but it pass'd                 160
  That also, and the Hero's skin inscribed.
  Quick flowed a sable current from the wound.
    As when a Carian or Mรฆonian maid
  Impurples ivory ordain'd to grace
  The cheek of martial steed; safe stored it lies,               165
  By many a Chief desired, but proves at last
  The stately trapping of some prince,[8] the pride
  Of his high pamper'd steed, nor less his own;
  Such, Menelaus, seem'd thy shapely thighs,
  Thy legs, thy feet, stained with thy trickling blood.          170
    Shudder'd King Agamemnon when he saw
  The blood fast trickling from the wound, nor less
  Shudder'd himself the bleeding warrior bold.
  But neck and barb observing from the flesh
  Extant, he gather'd heart, and lived again.                    175
  The royal Agamemnon, sighing, grasp'd
  The hand of Menelaus, and while all
  Their followers sigh'd around them, thus began.[9]
    I swore thy death, my brother, when I swore
  This truce, and set thee forth in sight of Greeks              180
  And Trojans, our sole champion; for the foe
  Hath trodden underfoot his sacred oath,
  And stained it with thy blood. But not in vain,
  The truce was ratified, the blood of lambs
  Poured forth, libation made, and right hands join'd            185
  In holy confidence. The wrath of Jove
  May sleep, but will not always; they shall pay
  Dear penalty; their own obnoxious heads
  Shall be the mulct, their children and their wives.
  For this I know, know surely; that a day                       190
  Shall come, when Ilium, when the warlike King
  Of Ilium and his host shall perish all.
  Saturnian Jove high-throned, dwelling in heaven,
  Resentful of this outrage, then shall shake
  His storm-clad รgis over them. He will;                        195
  I speak no fable. Time shall prove me true.
  But, oh my Menelaus, dire distress
  Awaits me, if thy close of life be come,
  And thou must die. Then ignominy foul
  Shall hunt me back to Argos long-desired;                      200
  For then all here will recollect their home,
  And, hope abandoning, will Helen yield
  To be the boast of Priam, and of Troy.
  So shall our toils be vain, and while thy bones
  Shall waste these clods beneath, Troy's haughty sons           205
  The tomb of Menelaus glory-crown'd
  Insulting barbarous, shall scoff at me.
  So may Atrides, shall they say, perform
  His anger still as he performed it here,
  Whither he led an unsuccessful host,                           210
  Whence he hath sail'd again without the spoils,
  And where he left his brother's bones to rot.
  So shall the Trojan speak; then open earth
  Her mouth, and hide me in her deepest gulfs!
    But him, the hero of the golden locks                        215
  Thus cheer'd. My brother, fear not, nor infect
  With fear the Grecians; the sharp-pointed reed
  Hath touch'd no vital part. The broider'd zone,
  The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt,
  Work of the armorer, its force repress'd.                      220
    Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.
  So be it brother! but the hand of one
  Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress
  The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power.
    He ended, and his noble herald, next,                        225
  Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick
  The son of รsculapius, leech renown'd,
  The prince Machaon. Bid him fly to attend
  The warlike Chieftain Menelaus; him
  Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,                         230
  A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft
  To his own glory, and to our distress.
    He spake, nor him the herald disobey'd,
  But through the Greeks bright-arm'd his course began
  The Hero seeking earnest on all sides                          235
  Machaon. Him, ere long, he station'd saw
  Amid the shielded-ranks of his brave band
  From steed-famed Tricca drawn, and at his side
  With accents ardor-wing'd, him thus address'd.
    Haste, Asclepiades! The King of men                          240
  Calls thee. Delay not. Thou must visit quick
  Brave Menelaus, Atreus' son, for him
  Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,
  A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft
  To his own glory, and to our distress.                         245
    So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course
  Through the wide host began. Arriving soon
  Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all
  The bravest of Achaia's host around
  The godlike hero press'd, he strove at once                    250
  To draw the arrow from his cincture forth.
  But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed
  His broider'd belt, his hauberk and his quilt,
  Work of the armorer, and laying bare
  His body where the bitter shaft had plow'd                     255
  His flesh, he suck'd the wound, then spread it o'er
  With drugs of balmy power, given on a time
  For friendship's sake by Chiron to his sire.
    While Menelaus thus the cares engross'd
  Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy               260
  'Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again
  Put on their armor, mindful of the fight.
  Then hadst thou[10] not great Agamemnon seen
  Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war,
  But ardent to begin his glorious task.                         265
  His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid
  He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon,
  Offspring of Ptolemy Piraรฏdes
  Detain'd apart; for him he strict enjoin'd
  Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs                       270
  Should seize him marshalling his numerous host.
  So forth he went, and through the files on foot
  Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw
  Alert, he roused them by his words the more.[11]
    Argives! abate no spark of all your fire.                    275
  Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first
  Transgress'd the truce the vultures shall devour,
  But we (their city taken) shall their wives
  Lead captive, and their children home to Greece.
    So cheer'd he them. But whom he saw supine,                  280
  Or in the rugged work of war remiss,
  In terms of anger them he stern rebuked.
    Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom'd!
  Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast,
  Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide                   285
  The champain, gaze and pant, and can no more?
  Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight.
  Is it your purpose patient here to wait
  Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore
  Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make                       290
  Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield?
    Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass'd
  Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived
  Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front
  Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar                     295
  The van he occupied, while in the rear
  Meriones harangued the most remote.
  Them so prepared the King of men beheld
  With joyful heart, and thus in courteous terms
  Instant the brave Idomeneus address'd.                         300
    Thee fighting, feasting, howsoe'er employed,
  I most respect, Idomeneus, of all
  The well-horsed Danรคi; for when the Chiefs
  Of Argos, banqueting, their beakers charge
  With rosy wine the honorable meed                              305
  Of valor, thou alone of all the Greeks
  Drink'st not by measure.[12] No--thy goblet stands
  Replenish'd still, and like myself thou know'st
  No rule or bound, save what thy choice prescribes.
  March. Seek the foe. Fight now as heretofore,                  310
    To whom Idomeneus of Crete replied,
  Atrides! all the friendship and the love
  Which I have promised will I well perform.
  Go; animate the rest, Chief after Chief
  Of the Achaians, that the fight begin.                         315
  For Troy has scatter'd to the winds all faith,
  All conscience; and for such her treachery foul
  Shall have large recompence of death and wo.
    He said, whom Agamemnon at his heart
  Exulting, pass'd, and in his progress came                     320
  Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared
  With all their cloud of infantry behind.
  As when the goat-herd on some rocky point
  Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o'er the deep
  By western gales, and rolling slow along,                      325
  To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems,
  And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight
  Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave;
  So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears,
  And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold,              330
  Close-following either Ajax to the fight.
    Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld,
  And in wing'd accents hail'd them as he pass'd.
    Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece!
  I move not you to duty; ye yourselves                          335
  Move others, and no lesson need from me.
  Jove, Pallas, and Apollo! were but all
  Courageous as yourselves, soon Priam's towers
  Should totter, and his Ilium storm'd and sack'd
  By our victorious bands, stoop to the dust.                    340
    He ceased, and still proceeding, next arrived
  Where stood the Pylian orator, his band
  Marshalling under all their leaders bold
  Alastor, Chromius, Pelagon the vast,
  Hรฆmon the prince, and Bias, martial Chief.                     345
  Chariot and horse he station'd in the front;
  His numerous infantry, a strong reserve
  Right valiant, in the rear; the worst, and those
  In whom he trusted least, he drove between,
  That such through mere necessity might act.                    350
  First to his charioteers he gave in charge
  Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard,
  Shunning confusion. Let no warrior, vain
  And overweening of his strength or skill,
  Start from his rank to dare the fight alone,                   355
  Or fall behind it, weakening whom he leaves.
  [13]And if, dismounted from his own, he climb
  Another's chariot, let him not affect
  Perverse the reins, but let him stand, his spear
  Advancing firm, far better so employ'd.                        360
  Such was the discipline, in ancient times,
  Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought
  Successful, and laid many a city low.
    So counsell'd them the venerable Chief
  Long time expert in arms; him also saw                         365
  King Agamemnon with delight, and said,
    Old Chief! ah how I wish, that thy firm heart
  Were but supported by as firm a knee!
  But time unhinges all. Oh that some youth
  Had thine old age, and thou wast young again!                  370
  To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied.
    Atrides, I could also ardent wish
  That I were now robust as when I struck
  Brave Ereuthalion[14] breathless to the ground!
  But never all their gifts the Gods confer                      375
  On man at once; if then I had the force
  Of youth, I suffer now the effects of age.
  Yet ancient as I am, I will be seen
  Still mingling with the charioteers, still prompt
  To give them counsel; for to counsel youth                     380
  Is the old warrior's province. Let the green
  In years, my juniors, unimpaired by time,
  Push with the lance, for they have strength to boast.
    So he, whom Agamemnon joyful heard,
  And passing thence, the son of Peteos found                    385
  Menestheus, foremost in equestrian fame,
  Among the brave Athenians; near to him
  Ulysses held his station, and at hand
  The Cephallenians stood, hardy and bold;
  For rumor none of the approaching fight                        390
  Them yet had reach'd, so recent had the stir
  Arisen in either host; they, therefore, watch'd
  Till the example of some other band
  Marching, should prompt them to begin the fight,
  But Agamemnon, thus, the King of men                           395
  Them seeing, sudden and severe reproved.
    Menestheus, son of Peteos prince renown'd,
  And thou, deviser of all evil wiles!
  Adept in artifice! why stand ye here
  Appall'd? why wait ye on this distant spot                     400
  'Till others move? I might expect from you
  More readiness to meet the burning war,
  Whom foremost I invite of all to share
  The banquet, when the Princes feast with me.
  There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there                 405
  To eat your savory food, and quaff your wine
  Delicious 'till satiety ensue;
  But here you could be well content to stand
  Spectators only, while ten Grecian troops
  Should wage before you the wide-wasting war.                   410
    To whom Ulysses, with resentful tone
  Dark-frowning, thus replied. What words are these
  Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause,
  Atrides, hast thou call'd me slow to fight?
  When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash                 415
  With you steed-tamer Trojans, mark me then;
  Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war
  So nearly touch thee, and thou so incline)
  The father of Telemachus, engaged
  Among the foremost Trojans. But thy speech                     420
  Was light as is the wind, and rashly made.
    When him thus moved he saw, the monarch smiled
  Complacent, and in gentler terms replied.
    Laรซrtes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
  Short reprimand and exhortation short                          425
  Suffice for thee, nor did I purpose more.
  For I have known thee long, that thou art one
  Of kindest nature, and so much my friend
  That we have both one heart. Go therefore thou,
  Lead on, and if a word have fallen amiss,                      430
  We will hereafter mend it, and may heaven
  Obliterate in thine heart its whole effect!
    He ceased, and ranging still along the line,
  The son of Tydeus, Diomede, perceived,
  Heroic Chief, by chariots all around                           435
  Environ'd, and by steeds, at side of whom
  Stood Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.
  Him also, Agamemnon, King of men,
  In accents of asperity reproved.
    Ah, son of Tydeus, Chief of dauntless heart                  440
  And of equestrian fame! why standest thou
  Appall'd, and peering through the walks of war?
  So did not Tydeus. In the foremost fight
  His favorite station was, as they affirm
  Who witness'd his exploits; I never saw                        445
  Or met him, but by popular report
  He was the bravest warrior of his day.
  Yet came he once, but not in hostile sort,
  To fair Mycenรฆ, by the godlike prince
  Attended, Polynices, at what time                              450
  The host was called together, and the siege
  Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes.
  Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band,
  Which we had gladly granted, but that Jove
  By unpropitious tokens interfered.                             455
  So forth they went, and on the reedy banks
  Arriving of Asopus, there thy sire
  By designation of the Greeks was sent
  Ambassador, and enter'd Thebes. He found
  In Eteocles' palace numerous guests,                           460
  The sons of Cadmus feasting, among whom,
  Although a solitary stranger, stood
  Thy father without fear, and challenged forth
  Their best to cope with him in manly games.
  Them Tydeus vanquish'd easily, such aid                        465
  Pallas vouchsafed him. Then the spur-arm'd race
  Of Cadmus was incensed, and fifty youths
  In ambush close expected his return.
  Them, Lycophontes obstinate in fight,
  Son of Autophonus, and Mรฆon, son                               470
  Of Hรฆmon, Chief of godlike stature, led.
  Those also Tydeus slew; Mรฆon except,
  (Whom, warned from heaven, he spared, and sent him home
  With tidings of the rest) he slew them all.
  Such was รtolian Tydeus; who begat                             475
  A son in speech his better, not in arms.
    He ended, and his sovereign's awful voice
  Tydides reverencing, nought replied;
  But thus the son of glorious Capaneus.
    Atrides, conscious of the truth, speak truth.                480
  We with our sires compared, superior praise
  Claim justly.[15] We, confiding in the aid
  Of Jove, and in propitious signs from heaven,
  Led to the city consecrate to Mars
  Our little host, inferior far to theirs,                       485
  And took seven-gated Thebes, under whose walls
  Our fathers by their own imprudence fell.
  Their glory, then, match never more with ours.
    He spake, whom with a frowning brow the brave
  Tydides answer'd. Sthenelus, my friend!                        490
  I give thee counsel. Mark it. Hold thy peace.
  If Agamemnon, who hath charge of all,
  Excite his well-appointed host to war,
  He hath no blame from me. For should the Greeks
  (Her people vanquished) win imperial Troy,                     495
  The glory shall be his; or, if his host
  O'erpower'd in battle perish, his the shame.
  Come, therefore; be it ours to rouse at once
  To action all the fury of our might.
    He said, and from his chariot to the plain                   500
  Leap'd ardent; rang the armor on the breast
  Of the advancing Chief; the boldest heart
  Had felt emotion, startled at the sound.
    As when the waves by Zephyrus up-heaved
  Crowd fast toward some sounding shore, at first,               505
  On the broad bosom of the deep their heads
  They curl on high, then breaking on the land
  Thunder, and o'er the rocks that breast the flood
  Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray;
  So moved the Greeks successive, rank by rank,                  510
  And phalanx after phalanx, every Chief
  His loud command proclaiming, while the rest,
  As voice in all those thousands none had been
  Heard mute; and, in resplendent armor clad,
  With martial order terrible advanced.                          515
  Not so the Trojans came. As sheep, the flock
  Of some rich man, by thousands in his court
  Penn'd close at milking time, incessant bleat,
  Loud answering all their bleating lambs without,
  Such din from Ilium's wide-spread host arose.                  520
  Nor was their shout, nor was their accent one,
  But mingled languages were heard of men
  From various climes. These Mars to battle roused,
  Those Pallas azure-eyed; nor Terror thence
  Nor Flight was absent, nor insatiate Strife,                   525
  Sister and mate of homicidal Mars,
  Who small at first, but swift to grow, from earth
  Her towering crest lifts gradual to the skies.
  She, foe alike to both, the brands dispersed
  Of burning hate between them, and the woes                     530
  Enhanced of battle wheresoe'er she pass'd.
    And now the battle join'd. Shield clash'd with shield[16]
  And spear with spear, conflicting corselets rang,
  Boss'd bucklers met, and tumult wild arose.
  Then, many a yell was heard, and many a shout                  535
  Loud intermix'd, the slayer o'er the maim'd
  Exulting, and the field was drench'd with blood.
  As when two winter torrents rolling down
  The mountains, shoot their floods through gulleys huge
  Into one gulf below, station'd remote                          540
  The shepherd in the uplands hears the roar;
  Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts.
  And first, Antilochus a Trojan Chief
  Slew Echepolus, from Thalysias sprung,
  Contending valiant in the van of Troy.                         545
  Him smiting on his crested casque, he drove
  The brazen lance into his front, and pierced
  The bones within; night overspread his eyes,
  And in fierce battle, like a tower, he fell.
  Him fallen by both feet Calchodon's son                        550
  Seized, royal Elephenor, leader brave
  Of the Abantes, and in haste to strip
  His armor, drew him from the fight aside.
  But short was that attempt. Him so employ'd
  Dauntless Agenor mark'd, and as he stoop'd,                    555
  In his unshielded flank a pointed spear
  Implanted deep; he languid sunk and died.
  So Elephenor fell, for whom arose
  Sharp conflict; Greeks and Trojans mutual flew
  Like wolves to battle, and man grappled man.                   560
  Then Telamonian Ajax, in his prime
  Of youthful vigor Simรถisius slew,[17]
  Son of Anthemion. Him on Simoรฏs' banks
  His mother bore, when with her parents once
  She came from Ida down to view the flocks,                     565
  And thence they named him; but his parents'
  He lived not to requite, in early youth
  Slain by the spear of Ajax famed in arms.
  For him advancing Ajax at the pap
  Wounded; right through his shoulder driven the point           570
  Stood forth behind; he fell, and press'd the dust.
  So in some spacious marsh the poplar falls
  Smooth-skinn'd, with boughs unladen save aloft;
  Some chariot-builder with his axe the trunk
  Severs, that he may warp it to a wheel                         575
  Of shapely form; meantime exposed it lies
  To parching airs beside the running stream;
  Such Simรถisius seemed, Anthemion's son,
  Whom noble Ajax slew. But soon at him
  Antiphus, son of Priam, bright in arms,                        580
  Hurl'd through the multitude his pointed spear.
  He erred from Ajax, but he pierced the groin
  Of Leucus, valiant warrior of the band
  Led by Ulysses. He the body dragg'd
  Apart, but fell beside it, and let fall,                       585
  Breathless himself, the burthen from his hand.
  Then burn'd Ulysses' wrath for Leucus slain,
  And through the foremost combatants, array'd
  In dazzling arms, he rush'd. Full near he stood,
  And, looking keen around him, hurl'd a lance.                  590
  Back fell the Trojans from before the face
  Dispersed of great Ulysses. Not in vain
  His weapon flew, but on the field outstretch'd
  A spurious son of Priam, from the shores
  Call'd of Abydus famed for fleetest mares,                     595
  Democoon; him, for Leucus' sake enraged,
  Ulysses through both temples with his spear
  Transpierced. The night of death hung on his eyes,
  And sounding on his batter'd arms he fell.
  Then Hector and the van of Troy retired;                       600
  Loud shout the Grecians; these draw off the dead,
  Those onward march amain, and from the heights
  Of Pergamus Apollo looking down
  In anger, to the Trojans called aloud.
    Turn, turn, ye Trojans! face your Grecian foes.              605
  They, like yourselves, are vulnerable flesh,
  Not adamant or steel. Your direst dread
  Achilles, son of Thetis radiant-hair'd,
  Fights not, but sullen in his fleet abides.[18]
    Such from the citadel was heard the voice                    610
  Of dread Apollo. But Minerva ranged
  Meantime, Tritonian progeny of Jove,
  The Grecians, rousing whom she saw remiss.
  Then Amarynceus' son, Diores, felt
  The force of fate, bruised by a rugged rock                    615
  At his right heel, which Pirus, Thracian Chief,
  The son of Imbrasus of รnos, threw.
  Bones and both tendons in its fall the mass
  Enormous crush'd. He, stretch'd in dust supine,
  With palms outspread toward his warrior friends                620
  Lay gasping life away. But he who gave
  The fatal blow, Pirus, advancing, urged
  Into his navel a keen lance, and shed
  His bowels forth; then, darkness veil'd his eyes.
    Nor Pirus long survived; him through the breast              625
  Above the pap, รtolian Thoas pierced,
  And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear.
  Then Thoas swift approach'd, pluck'd from the wound
  His stormy spear, and with his falchion bright
  Gashing his middle belly, stretch'd him dead.                  630
  Yet stripp'd he not the slain, whom with long spears
  His Thracians hairy-scalp'd[19] so round about
  Encompassed, that though bold and large of limb
  Were Thoas, from before them him they thrust
  Staggering and reeling in his forced retreat.                  635
    They therefore in the dust, the Epean Chief
  Diores, and the Thracian, Pirus lay
  Stretch'd side by side, with numerous slain around.
    Then had Minerva led through all that field
  Some warrior yet unhurt, him sheltering safe                   640
  From all annoyance dread of dart or spear,
  No cause of blame in either had he found
  That day, so many Greeks and Trojans press'd,
  Extended side by side, the dusty plain.




                              THE ILIAD.

                               BOOK V.




                     ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK.


Diomede is extraordinarily distinguished. He kills Pandarus, who had
violated the truce, and wounds first Venus and then Mars.




                               BOOK V.


  Then Athenรฆan Pallas on the son
  Of Tydeus,[1] Diomede, new force conferr'd
  And daring courage, that the Argives all
  He might surpass, and deathless fame achieve.
  Fires on his helmet and his shield around                        5
  She kindled, bright and steady as the star
  Autumnal,[2] which in Ocean newly bathed
  Assumes fresh beauty; with such glorious beams
  His head encircling and his shoulders broad,
  She urged him forth into the thickest fight.                    10
    There lived a man in Troy, Dares his name,
  The priest of Vulcan; rich he was and good,
  The father of two sons, Idรฆus this,
  That, Phegeus call'd; accomplish'd warriors both.
  These, issuing from their phalanx, push'd direct                15
  Their steeds at Diomede, who fought on foot.
  When now small interval was left between,
  First Phegeus his long-shadow'd spear dismiss'd;
  But over Diomede's left shoulder pass'd
  The point, innocuous. Then his splendid lance                   20
  Tydides hurl'd; nor ineffectual flew
  The weapon from his hand, but Phegeus pierced
  His paps between, and forced him to the ground.
  At once, his sumptuous chariot left, down leap'd
  Idรฆsus, wanting courage to defend                               25
  His brother slain; nor had he scaped himself
  His louring fate, but Vulcan, to preserve
  His ancient priest from unmixt sorrow, snatch'd
  The fugitive in darkness wrapt, away.
  Then brave Tydides, driving off the steeds,                     30
  Consign'd them to his fellow-warriors' care,
  That they might lead them down into the fleet.
    The valiant Trojans, when they saw the sons
  Of Dares, one beside his chariot slain,
  And one by flight preserved, through all their host             35
  Felt consternation. Then Minerva seized
  The hand of fiery Mars, and thus she spake.
    Gore-tainted homicide, town-battering Mars!
  Leave we the Trojans and the Greeks to wage
  Fierce fight alone, Jove prospering whom he will,               40
  So shall we not provoke our father's ire.
    She said, and from the fight conducted forth
  The impetuous Deity, whom on the side
  She seated of Scamander deep-embank'd.[3]
    And now the host of Troy to flight inclined                   45
  Before the Grecians, and the Chiefs of Greece
  Each slew a warrior. Agamemnon first
  Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl'd.
  Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight
  Turn'd foremost, when the monarch in his spine                  50
  Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt,
  And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell,
  And loud his batter'd armor rang around.
    By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died,
  Phรฆstus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy,                      55
  Son of Mรฆonian Borus; him his steeds
  Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown'd
  Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night
  Involved him; from his chariot down he fell,[4]
  And the attendant Cretans stripp'd his arms.                    60
    But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew
  With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius' son,
  A skilful hunter; for Diana him,
  Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds
  Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred.                      65
  But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour
  Avail'd him not, nor his own matchless skill;
  For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed,
  Him flying wounded in the spine between
  His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast.          70
  Prone on his loud-resounding arms he fell.
    Next, by Meriones, Phereclus died,
  Son of Harmonides. All arts that ask
  A well-instructed hand his sire had learn'd,
  For Pallas dearly loved him. He the fleet,                      75
  Prime source of harm to Troy and to himself,
  For Paris built, unskill'd to spell aright
  The oracles predictive of the wo.
  Phereclus fled; Meriones his flight
  Outstripping, deep in his posterior flesh                       80
  A spear infix'd; sliding beneath the bone
  It grazed his bladder as it pass'd, and stood
  Protruded far before. Low on his knees
  Phereclus sank, and with a shriek expired.
  Pedรฆus, whom, although his spurious son,                        85
  Antenor's wife, to gratify her lord,
  Had cherish'd as her own--him Meges slew.
  Warlike Phylides[5] following close his flight,
  His keen lance drove into his poll, cut sheer
  His tongue within, and through his mouth enforced               90
  The glittering point. He, prostrate in the dust,
  The cold steel press'd between his teeth and died.
    Eurypylus, Evemon's son, the brave
  Hypsenor slew; Dolopion was his sire,
  Priest of Scamander, reverenced as a God.                       95
  In vain before Eurypylus he fled;
  He, running, with his falchion lopp'd his arm
  Fast by the shoulder; on the field his hand
  Fell blood-distained, and destiny severe
  With shades of death for ever veil'd his eyes.                 100
    Thus strenuous they the toilsome battle waged.
  But where Tydides fought, whether in aid
  Of Ilium's host, or on the part of Greece,
  Might none discern. For as a winter-flood
  Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away;[6]                  105
  The buttress'd bridge checks not its sudden force,
  The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields
  Luxuriant, falls before it; finish'd works
  Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye,
  Now levell'd, after ceaseless rain from Jove;                  110
  So drove Tydides into sudden flight
  The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled
  Before the terror of his single arm.
    When him Lycaon's son illustrious saw
  Scouring the field, and from before his face                   115
  The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent
  Against Tydides his elastic bow.
  The arrow met him in his swift career
  Sure-aim'd; it struck direct the hollow mail
  Of his right shoulder, with resistless force                   120
  Transfix'd it, and his hauberk stain'd with blood.
  Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd.
    Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard.
  Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem
  His death not distant far, if me the King[7]                   125
  Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy.
    So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart
  Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads
  He stood, and to the son of Capaneus
  His charioteer and faithful friend he said.                    130
    Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,
  And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.
    He spake; at once the son of Capaneus
  Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft
  Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail             135
  Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray'd.
    Unconquer'd daughter of Jove รgis-arm'd!
  If ever me, propitious, or my sire
  Thou hast in furious fight help'd heretofore,
  Now aid me also. Bring within the reach                        140
  Of my swift spear, Oh grant me to strike through
  The warrior who hath check'd my course, and boasts
  The sun's bright beams for ever quench'd to me![8]
    He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs,
  She wing'd him with alacrity divine,                           145
  And, standing at his side, him thus bespake.
    Now Diomede, be bold! Fight now with Troy.
  To thee, thy father's spirit I impart
  Fearless; shield-shaking Tydeus felt the same.
  I also from thine eye the darkness purge                       150
  Which dimm'd thy sight[9] before, that thou may'st know
  Both Gods and men; should, therefore, other God
  Approach to try thee, fight not with the powers
  Immortal; but if foam-born Venus come,
  Her spare not. Wound her with thy glittering spear.            155
    So spake the blue-eyed Deity, and went,
  Then with the champions in the van again
  Tydides mingled; hot before, he fights
  With threefold fury now, nor less enraged
  Than some gaunt lion whom o'erleaping light                    160
  The fold, a shepherd hath but gall'd, not kill'd,
  Him irritating more; thenceforth the swain
  Lurks unresisting; flies the abandon'd flock;
  Heaps slain on heaps he leaves, and with a bound
  Surmounting all impediment, escapes;                           165
  Such seem'd the valiant Diomede incensed
  To fury, mingling with the host of Troy.
    Astynoรผs and Hypenor first he slew;
  One with his brazen lance above the pap
  He pierced, and one with his huge falchion smote               170
  Fast by the key-bone,[10] from the neck and spine
  His parted shoulder driving at a blow.
    Them leaving, Polyides next he sought
  And Abas, sons of a dream-dealing seer,
  Eurydamas; their hoary father's dreams                         175
  Or not interpreted, or kept concealed,
  Them saved not, for by Diomede they died.
  Xanthus and Thรถon he encounter'd next,
  Both sons of Phรฆnops, sons of his old age,
  Who other heir had none of all his wealth,                     180
  Nor hoped another, worn with many years.
  Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain'd
  To the old man but sorrow for his sons
  For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs.
  Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne                         185
  Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand
  Resistless. As a lion on the herd
  Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browse,
  Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer,
  So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall,                190
  Tydides hurl'd together to the ground,
  Then stripp'd their splendid armor, and the steeds
  Consigned and chariot to his soldiers' care.
    รneas him discern'd scattering the ranks,
  And through the battle and the clash of spears                 195
  Went seeking godlike Pandarus; ere long
  Finding Lycaon's martial son renown'd,
  He stood before him, and him thus address'd.
    Thy bow, thy feather'd shafts, and glorious name
  Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy                    200
  Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel.
  Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief
  Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host
  Of Ilium thus, conquering where'er he flies,
  And who hath slaughter'd numerous brave in arms,               205
  But him some Deity I rather deem
  Avenging on us his neglected rites,
  And who can stand before an angry God?
    Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.
  Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail'd,                     210
  รneas! By his buckler which I know,
  And by his helmet's height, considering, too
  His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold;
  Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God.
  But if bold Diomede indeed he be                               215
  Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven
  His fury thus prevails, but at his side
  Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away
  From him the arrow to a devious course.
  Already, at his shoulder's hollow mail                         220
  My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem'd
  Dismiss'd full sure to Pluto ere his time
  But he survives; whom therefore I at last
  Perforce conclude some angry Deity.
  Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend,                       225
  Who have eleven chariots in the stands
  Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all
  O'ermantled, strong, new finish'd, with their steeds
  In pairs beside them, eating winnow'd grain.
  Me much Lycaon my old valiant sire                             230
  At my departure from his palace gates
  Persuaded, that my chariot and my steeds
  Ascending, I should so conduct my bands
  To battle; counsel wise, and ill-refused!
  But anxious, lest (the host in Troy so long                    235
  Immew'd) my steeds, fed plenteously at home,
  Should here want food, I left them, and on foot
  To Ilium came, confiding in my bow
  Ordain'd at last to yield me little good.
